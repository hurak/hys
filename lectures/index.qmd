This website constitutes the (work-in-progress) lecture notes for the graduate course on Hybrid Systems ([B3M35HYS](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/cz/education/bk/predmety/67/72/p6772006.html), [BE3M35HYS](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/en/education/bk/predmety/68/41/p6841906.html)) taught within [Cybernetics and Robotics](https://kyr.fel.cvut.cz) graduate program at [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://fel.cvut.cz), [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://cvut.cz), Czechia. 

Each of the 14 topics/chapters corresponds to a single weekly block covered by a lecture, a seminar/exercise, and possibly some homework.

Although most of the material needed for the course is here, occasionally we may refer the officially enrolled students to the course page within the [FEL Moodle](https://moodle.fel.cvut.cz) system for some other material.
