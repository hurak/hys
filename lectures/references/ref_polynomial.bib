  abstract = {This tutorial is about new system analysis techniques that were developed in the past few years based on the sum of squares decomposition. We present stability and robust stability analysis tools for different classes of systems: systems described by nonlinear ordinary differential equations or differential algebraic equations, hybrid systems with nonlinear subsystems and/or nonlinear switching surfaces, and time-delay systems described by nonlinear functional differential equations. We also discuss how different analysis questions such as model validation and safety verification can be answered for uncertain nonlinear and hybrid systems.}

In this minisymposium we show how the Julia and JuMP ecosystems are particularly well suited for the effortless construction of these problems and the development of state-of-the-art solvers for them. Polynomial and moment optimization problems are infinite dimensional optimization problems that can model a wide range of problems such as shape-constrained polynomial regression, optimal control of dynamical systems, region of attraction, polynomial matrix decomposition, smooth maximum-likelihood density estimation, AC power systems, experimental design, and computation of Nash equilibria. In this minisymposium we show how the Julia and JuMP ecosystems are particularly well suited for constructing and solving these problems. In particular, we show how the JuMP extensions SumOfSquares/PolyJuMP allow for an effortless construction of these problems and how they provide a flexible and customizable building block for additional packages such as JuliaMoments. We also show how various features of the Julia programming language are used in the state-of-the-art solvers Hypatia.jl and Aspasia.jl. Finally, we showcase specific uses of these tools for applications in engineering and statistics.}

Its reliance on relatively large-scale semidefinite programming, however, has seriously challenged its ability to scale in many practical applications. In this paper, we introduce DSOS and SDSOS optimization as more tractable alternatives to sum of squares optimization that rely instead on linear programming and second order cone programming. These are optimization problems over certain subsets of sum of squares polynomials and positive semidefinite matrices and can be of potential interest in general applications of semidefinite programming where scalability is a limitation.}

  abstract = {We propose a homogeneous primal-dual interior-point method to solve sum-of-squares optimization problems by combining nonsymmetric conic optimization techniques and polynomial interpolation. The approach optimizes directly over the sum-of-squares cone and its dual, circumventing the semidefinite programming (SDP) reformulation, which requires a large number of auxiliary variables when the degree of sum-of-squares polynomials is large. As a result, it has substantially lower theoretical time and space complexity than the conventional SDP-based approach as the degree increases. Although our approach avoids the SDP reformulation, an optimal solution to the semidefinite program can be recovered with little additional effort. Computational results confirm that the proposed method is several orders of magnitude faster than the SDP-based approach for optimization problems over high-degree sum-of-squares polynomials.}

We present these hierarchies of approximations and their main properties: asymptotic/finite convergence, optimality certificate, and extraction of global optimum solutions.

  abstract = {In this paper we present a universal solution to the generalized moment problem, with a nonclassical complexity constraint. We show that this solution can be obtained by minimizing a strictly convex nonlinear functional. This optimization problem is derived in two different ways. We first derive this intrinsically, in a geometric way, by path integration of a one-form which defines the generalized moment problem. It is observed that this one-form is closed and defined on a convex set, and thus exact with, perhaps surprisingly, a strictly convex primitive function. We also derive this convex functional as the dual problem of a problem to maximize a cross entropy functional. In particular, these approaches give a constructive parameterization of all solutions to the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem, with possible higher-order interpolation at certain points in the complex plane, with a degree constraint as well as all solutions to the rational covariance extension problem --- two areas which have been advanced by the work of Hidenori Kimura. Illustrations of these results in system identification and probability are also mentioned.},

We then show how sum of squares techniques can be used to tackle these problems, which are hard to solve in general. We conclude by highlighting some directions that could be pursued to further disseminate sum of squares techniques within more applied fields. Among other things, we briefly address the current challenge that scalability represents for optimization problems that involve sum of squares polynomials and discuss recent trends in software development.},
