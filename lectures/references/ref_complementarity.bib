The concepts are related to stationarity conditions for certain smooth programs as well as to stationarity concepts for a nonsmooth exact penalty function. Further, we present Fiacco-McCormick type second order optimality conditions and an extension of the stability results of Robinson and Kojima to mathematical programs with complementarity constraints.}

This approach is appealing because it allows existing off-the-shelf NLP solvers to tackle large instances of MPCCs. Numerical experience on MacMPEC, a large collection of MPCC test problems is presented. Our experience indicates that sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods are very well suited for solving MPCCs and at present outperform interior-point solvers both in terms of speed and reliability. All NLP solvers also compare very favorably to special MPCC solvers on tests published in the literature.}

This work extends a previously presented algorithm based on a sequential convex programming approach applied to a standard penalty reformulation.

  abstract = {Mathematical programs with complementarity constraints are notoriously difficult to solve due to their nonconvexity and lack of constraint qualifications in every feasible point. This letter focuses on the subclass of quadratic programs with linear complementarity constraints. A novel approach to solving a penalty reformulation using sequential convex programming and a homotopy on the penalty parameter is introduced. Linearizing the necessarily nonconvex penalty function yields convex quadratic subproblems, which have a constant Hessian matrix throughout all iterates. This allows solution computation with a single KKT matrix factorization. Furthermore, a globalization scheme is introduced in which the underlying merit function is minimized analytically, and guarantee of descent is provided at each iterate. The algorithmic features and possible computational speedups are illustrated in a numerical experiment.}
