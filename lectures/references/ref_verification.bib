  abstract = {Lyapunov's direct method, which is based on the existence of a scalar function of the state that decreases monotonically along trajectories, still serves as the primary tool for establishing stability of nonlinear systems. Since the main challenge in stability analysis based on Lyapunov theory is always to nd a suitable Lyapunov function, weakening the requirements of the Lyapunov function is of great interest. In this thesis, we relax the monotonicity requirement of Lyapunov's theorem to enlarge the class of functions that can provide certicates of stability. Both the discrete time case and the continuous time case are covered. Throughout the thesis, special attention is given to techniques from convex optimization that allow for computationally tractable ways of searching for Lyapunov functions. Our theoretical contributions are therefore amenable to convex programming formulations. In the discrete time case, we propose two new sucient conditions for global asymptotic stability that allow the Lyapunov functions to increase locally, but guarantee an average decrease every few steps. Our first condition is nonconvex, but allows an intuitive interpretation. The second condition, which includes the first one as a special case, is convex and can be cast as a semidenite program. We show that when non-monotonic Lyapunov functions exist, one can construct a more complicated function that decreases monotonically. We demonstrate the strength of our methodology over standard Lyapunov theory through examples from three different classes of dynamical systems. First, we consider polynomial dynamics where we utilize techniques from sum-of-squares programming. Second, analysis of piecewise ane systems is performed. Here, connections to the method of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions are made.},

  abstract = {Balancing safety and performance is one of the predominant challenges in modern control system design. Moreover, it is crucial to robustly ensure safety without inducing unnecessary conservativeness that degrades performance. In this work, we present a constructive approach for safety-critical control synthesis via control barrier functions (CBFs). By filtering a hand-designed controller via a CBF, we are able to attain performant behavior while providing rigorous guarantees of safety. In the face of disturbances, robust safety and performance are simultaneously achieved through the notion of input-to-state safety (ISSf). We take a tutorial approach by developing the CBF-design methodology in parallel with an inverted pendulum example, making the challenges and sensitivities in the design process concrete. To establish the capability of the proposed approach, we consider the practical setting of safety-critical design via CBFs for a connected automated vehicle (CAV) in the form of a class-8 truck without a trailer. Through experimentation, we see the impact of unmodeled disturbances in the truck's actuation system on the safety guarantees provided by CBFs. We characterize these disturbances and using ISSf, produce a robust controller that achieves safety without conceding performance. We evaluate our design both in simulation, and for the first time on an automotive system, experimentally.}

The framework is designed to ensure an energy-critical goal that is defined in the form of an upper bound on the energy consumption. In order to respond to the changing traffic environment, this bound is changed based on the preceding vehicle's energy consumption. Control barrier functions are used to obtain a condition on the control input such that the energy-critical goal is formally guaranteed. This condition is used in a quadratic program scheme as a constraint, and the resulting controller intervenes the driver input in a minimally-invasive fashion. The effect of the energy-critical controller is demonstrated in data-based simulations, where up to 25\% improvement in energy consumption is observed compared to an energy-inefficient driver, without drastically changing the car-following performance.}

  abstract = {The autonomous driving industry is continuously dealing with safety-critical scenarios, and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is a powerful control strategy for handling such situations. However, standard safety constraints are not scalable and require a long NMPC horizon. Moreover, the adoption of NMPC in the automotive industry is limited by the heavy computation of numerical optimization routines. To address those issues, this paper presents a real-time capable NMPC for automated driving in urban environments, using control barrier functions (CBFs). Furthermore, the designed NMPC is based on a novel collocation transcription approach, named RESAFE/COL, that allows to reduce the number of optimization variables while still guaranteeing the continuous time (nonlinear) inequality constraints satisfaction, through regional convex hull approximation. RESAFE/COL is proven to be 5 times faster than multiple shooting and more tractable for embedded hardware without a decrease in the performance, nor accuracy and safety of the numerical solution. We validate our NMPC-CBF with RESAFE/COL on digital twins of the vehicle and the urban environment and show the safe controller's ability to improve crash avoidance by 91{\textbackslash}\%.

It is a fundamental problem motivated by many applications in formal verification, controller synthesis, and estimation, to name only a few. This article focuses on a class of methods for computing a guaranteed overapproximation of the reachable set of continuous and hybrid systems, relying predominantly on set propagation; starting from the set of initial states, these techniques iteratively propagate a sequence of sets according to the system dynamics. After a review of set representation and computation, the article presents the state of the art of set propagation techniques for reachability analysis of linear, nonlinear, and hybrid systems. It ends with a discussion of successful applications of reachability analysis to real-world problems.}

  abstract = {Safety critical systems involve the tight coupling between potentially conflicting control objectives and safety constraints. As a means of creating a formal framework for controlling systems of this form, and with a view toward automotive applications, this paper develops a methodology that allows safety conditions-expressed as control barrier functions-to be unified with performance objectives-expressed as control Lyapunov functions-in the context of real-time optimization-based controllers. Safety conditions are specified in terms of forward invariance of a set, and are verified via two novel generalizations of barrier functions; in each case, the existence of a barrier function satisfying Lyapunov-like conditions implies forward invariance of the set, and the relationship between these two classes of barrier functions is characterized. In addition, each of these formulations yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), providing inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). The mediation of safety and performance through a QP is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, two automotive control problems that present both safety and performance considerations coupled with actuator bounds.}

  abstract = {In control theory, complicated dynamics such as systems of (nonlinear) differential equations are controlled mostly to achieve stability. This fundamental property, which can be with respect to a desired operating point or a prescribed trajectory, is often linked with optimality, which requires minimizing a certain cost along the trajectories of a stable system. In formal verification (model checking), simple systems, such as finite-state transition graphs that model computer programs or digital circuits, are checked against rich specifications given as formulas of temporal logics. The formal synthesis problem, in which the goal is to synthesize or control a finite system from a temporal logic specification, has recently received increased interest. In this article, we review some recent results on the connection between optimal control and formal synthesis. Specifically, we focus on the following problem: Given a cost and a correctness temporal logic specification for a dynamical system, generate an optimal control strategy that satisfies the specification. We first provide a short overview of automata-based methods, in which the dynamics of the system are mapped to a finite abstraction that is then controlled using an automaton corresponding to the specification. We then provide a detailed overview of a class of methods that rely on mapping the specification and the dynamics to constraints of an optimization problem. We discuss advantages and limitations of these two types of approaches and suggest directions for future research.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we formulate the problem of characterizing the stability of a piecewise affine (PWA) system as a verification problem. The basic idea is to take the whole IRnas the set of initial conditions, and check that all the trajectories go to the origin. More precisely, we test for semi-global stability by restricting the set of initial conditions to an (arbitrarily large) bounded set X(0), and label as ``asymptotically stable in T steps'' the trajectories that enter an invariant set around the origin within a finite time T, or as ``unstable in T steps'' the trajectories which enter a set Xinstof (very large) states. Subsets of X(0) leading to none of the two previous cases are labeled as ``non-classifiable in T steps''. The domain of asymptotical stability in T steps is a subset of the domain of attraction of an equilibrium point, and has the practical meaning of collecting the initial conditions from which the settling time to a specified set around the origin is smaller than T. In addition, it can be computed algorithmically in finite time. Such an algorithm requires the computation of reach sets, in a similar fashion as what has been proposed for verification of hybrid systems. In this paper we present a substantial extension of the verification algorithm presented in [6] for stability characterization of PWA systems, based on linear and mixed-integer linear programming. As a result, given a set of initial conditions we are able to determine its partition into subsets of trajectories which are asymptotically stable, or unstable, or non-classifiable in T steps.},

The major contribution of this manuscript is a closed-form solution for exact forward reachable sets of discrete-time, linear hybrid systems modeled as mixed logical dynamical systems. The proposed approach captures the worst-case exponential growth in the number of convex sets required to represent the nonconvex reachable set while exhibiting only linear growth in the complexity of the hybrid zonotope set representation. Redundancy removal techniques are provided that leverage binary trees to store the combinations of binary factors of the hybrid zonotope that map to nonempty convex subsets. Numerical examples show the hybrid zonotope's ability to compactly represent nonconvex reachable sets with an exponential number of features. Furthermore, the hybrid zonotope is shown to be closed under linear mappings, Minkowski sums, generalized intersections, and halfspace intersections.}

  abstract = {Reachability analysis computes an envelope encompassing the reachable states of a hybrid automaton within a given time horizon. It is known to be a computationally intensive task. In this case study paper, we consider the application of reachability analysis on a mathematical model unifying two key warfighting functions: Combat, and Command-and-Control (C2). Reachability here has a meaning of whether, given a range of initial combat forces and a C2 network and various uncertainties, one side can survive combat with intact forces while the adversary is diminished to zero. These are questions which arise in military Operations Research (OR). This paper is the first to utilize the notions of a hybrid automaton and reachability analysis in the area of OR. We explore the applicability and scalability of Taylor-model based reachability techniques in this domain. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of reachability analysis in the context of OR.},

This article investigates the problems of verifying positive invariance of a semialgebraic set as well as synthesizing sets that can be made positive invariant through control barrier function (CBF)-based control. The key to our approach consists of mapping conditions for positive invariance to sum-of-squares constraints via the Positivstellensatz from real algebraic geometry. Based on these conditions, we propose a framework for verifying safety of CBF-based control including single CBFs, high-order CBFs, multi-CBFs, and systems with trigonometric dynamics and actuation constraints. In the area of synthesis, we propose algorithms for constructing CBFs, namely, an alternating-descent approach and a local CBF approach. We evaluate our approach through case studies on quadrotor UAV and power converter test systems.}

Notably, quality-cost expended on performing VVT activities and correcting system defects consumes about half of the overall engineering cost. Verification, Validation and Testing of Engineered Systems provides a comprehensive compendium of VVT activities and corresponding VVT methods for implementation throughout the entire lifecycle of an engineered system. In addition, the book strives to alleviate the fundamental testing conundrum, namely: What should be tested? How should one test? When should one test? And, when should one stop testing? In other words, how should one select a VVT strategy and how it be optimized?The book is organized in three parts: The first part provides introductory material about systems and VVT concepts. This part presents a comprehensive explanation of the role of VVT in the process of engineered systems (Chapter-1). The second part describes 40 systems' development VVT activities (Chapter-2) and 27 systems' post-development activities (Chapter-3). Corresponding to these activities, this part also describes 17 non-testing systems' VVT methods (Chapter-4) and 33 testing systems' methods (Chapter-5). The third part of the book describes ways to model systems' quality cost, time and risk (Chapter-6), as well as ways to acquire quality data and optimize the VVT strategy in the face of funding, time and other resource limitations as well as different business objectives (Chapter-7). Finally, this part describes the methodology used to validate the quality model along with a case study describing a system's quality improvements (Chapter-8).Fundamentally, this book is written with two categories of audience in mind. The first category is composed of VVT practitioners, including Systems, Test, Production and Maintenance engineers as well as first and second line managers. The second category is composed of students and faculties of Systems, Electrical, Aerospace, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering schools. This book may be fully covered in two to three graduate level semesters; although parts of the book may be covered in one semester. University instructors will most likely use the book to provide engineering students with knowledge about VVT, as well as to give students an introduction to formal modeling and optimization of VVT strategy.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of synthesizing provably correct controllers for linear systems with reach-avoid specifications. Discrete abstraction-based controller synthesis techniques have been developed for linear and nonlinear systems with various types of specifications. However, these methods typically suffer from the state space explosion problem. Our solution decomposes the overall synthesis problem into two smaller, and more tractable problems: one synthesis problem for an open-loop controller, which can produce a reference trajectory, and a second for synthesizing a tracking controller, which can enforce the other trajectories to follow the reference trajectory. As a key building-block result, we show that, once a tracking controller is fixed, the reachable states from an initial neighborhood, subject to any disturbance, can be overapproximated by a sequence of ellipsoids, with shapes that are independent of the open-loop controller. Hence, the open-loop controller can be synthesized independently to meet the reach-avoid specification for an initial neighborhood. Moreover, we are able to reduce the problem of synthesizing open-loop controllers to satisfiability problems over quantifier-free linear real arithmetic. The number of linear constraints in the satisfiability problem is linear to the number of hyperplanes as the surfaces of the polytopic obstacles and goal sets. The overall synthesis algorithm, computes a tracking controller, and then iteratively covers the entire initial set to find open-loop controllers for initial neighborhoods. The algorithm is sound and, for a class of robust systems, is also complete. We implement this synthesis algorithm in a tool RealSyn ver 2.0 and use it on several benchmarks with up to 20 dimensions. Experiment results are very promising: RealSyn ver 2.0 can find controllers for most of the benchmarks in seconds.}

Examples of hybrid systems include medical equipment, manufacturing controllers, automotive controllers, and robots. The formal analysis of the mixed digital-analog nature of these systems requires a model that incorporates the discrete behavior of computer programs with the continuous behavior of environment variables, such as temperature and pressure. Hybrid automata capture both types of behavior by combining finite automata with differential inclusions (i.e. differential inequalities). HyTech is a symbolic model checker for linear hybrid automata, an expressive, yet automatically analyzable, subclass of hybrid automata. A key feature of HyTech is its ability to perform parametric analysis, i.e. to determine the values of design parameters for which a linear hybrid automaton satisfies a temporal requirement.},

In this case study, we present linear and nonlinear benchmark models of an active chaser spacecraft performing rendezvous toward a passive, orbiting target. The system is modeled as a hybrid automaton, where the chaser must adhere to different sets of constraints in each discrete mode. A switched LQR controller is designed accordingly to meet this collection of physical and geometric safety constraints, while maintaining liveness in navigating toward the target spacecraft. We extend this benchmark problem to check for passive safety, which is collision avoidance along a passive, propulsion-free trajectory that may be followed in the event of system failures. We show that existing hybrid verification tools like SpaceEx, C2E2, and our own implementation of a simulation-driven verification tool can robustly verify this system with respect to the requirements, and a variety of relevant initial conditions.},

We start by specifying a vehicle parking task using linear temporal logic formulae that can be model checked for feasibility. The model-checking is facilitated by the construction of a temporal logic tree via Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Once we know the parking task is feasible for our vehicle model, we utilize the constructed temporal logic tree to directly synthesize control sets. Our approach synthesizes control sets that are least-restrictive in the context of the specification, since they permit any control inputs that are guaranteed not to violate the specification. This least-restrictive characteristic allows for the application of our approach to vehicles under different modes of operation (e.g., human-in-the-loop shared autonomy or fully-automated schemes). Implementing in both simulation and on hardware, we demonstrate the approach's potential for ensuring the safety of vehicles throughout parking tasks, whether they are operated by humans or automated driving systems.}

The method only requires knowledge of a finite collection of one-step transitions of the discrete-time dynamics, without the requirement of segments of trajectories or the control inputs that effected the transitions to be available. The approach uses a novel characterization of the MPI and MCI sets as the solution to an infinite-dimensional linear programming (LP) problem in the space of continuous functions, with the optimum being attained by a (Lipschitz) continuous function under mild assumptions. The infinite-dimensional LP is then approximated by restricting the decision variable to a finite-dimensional subspace and by imposing the nonnegativity constraint of this LP only on the available data samples. This leads to a single finite-dimensional LP that can be easily solved using off-the-shelf solvers. We analyze the convergence rate and sample complexity, proving probabilistic as well as hard guarantees on the volume error of the approximations. The approach is very general, requiring minimal underlying assumptions. In particular, the dynamics is not required to be polynomial or even continuous (forgoing some of the theoretical results). Detailed numerical examples up to state-space dimension 10 with code available online demonstrate the method.}

First, we show that the stability and performance of a polynomial dynamical system controlled by a neural network with semialgebraically representable activation functions (e.g., ReLU) can be certified by convex semidefinite programming. The result is based on the fact that the semialgebraic representation of the activation functions and polynomial dynamics allows one to search for a Lyapunov function using polynomial sum-of-squares methods. Second, we remark that even in the case of a linear system controlled by a neural network with ReLU activation functions, the problem of verifying asymptotic stability is undecidable. Finally, under additional assumptions, we establish a converse result on the existence of a polynomial Lyapunov function for this class of systems. Numerical results with code available online on examples of state-space dimension up to 50 and neural networks with several hundred neurons and up to 30 layers demonstrate the method.}

  abstract = {Ellipsoids are a common representation for reachability analysis, because they can be transformed efficiently under affine maps, and allow conservative approximation of Minkowski sums, which let one incorporate uncertainty and linearization error in a dynamical system by expanding the size of the reachable set. Zonotopes, a type of symmetric, convex polytope, are similarly frequently used due to efficient numerical implementation of affine maps and exact Minkowski sums. Both of these representations also enable efficient, convex collision detection for fault detection or formal verification tasks, wherein one checks if the reachable set of a system collides (i.e., intersects) with an unsafe set. However, both representations often result in conservative representations for reachable sets of arbitrary systems, and neither is closed under intersection. Recently, representations such as constrained zonotopes and constrained polynomial zonotopes have been shown to overcome some of these conservativeness challenges, and are closed under intersection. However, constrained zonotopes can not represent shapes with smooth boundaries such as ellipsoids, and constrained polynomial zonotopes can require solving a non-convex program for collision checking or fault detection. This paper introduces ellipsotopes, a set representation that is closed under affine maps, Minkowski sums, and intersections. Ellipsotopes combine the advantages of ellipsoids and zonotopes while ensuring convex collision checking. The utility of this representation is demonstrated on several examples.},

  abstract = {Computing control invariant sets is paramount in many applications. The families of sets commonly used for computations are ellipsoids and polyhedra. However, searching for a control invariant set over the family of ellipsoids is conservative for systems more complex than unconstrained linear time invariant systems. Moreover, even if the control invariant set may be approximated arbitrarily closely by polyhedra, the complexity of the polyhedra may grow rapidly in certain directions. An attractive generalization of these two families are piecewise semi-ellipsoids. We provide in this letter a convex programming approach for computing control invariant sets of this family.}

In the first part, after exposing existing approaches for reachability analysis of linear systems, we present the main contribution of the thesis: a new algorithmic scheme for linear time-invariant systems that definitely outperforms existing algorithms. As the exact implementation furnishes a representation of the reachable sets that is sometimes hard to manipulate, we propose an approximate version that is not subject to the wrapping effect, an uncontrolled growth of the approximation errors. We also discuss a variant of this algorithm specialized to support functions, a functional representation of convex sets. In the second part, we extend this work to hybrid systems. We first show how to deal with the constraints on the continuous dynamics imposed by the invariants. Then, we present algorithms for approximating the intersection of the continuous reachable sets with hyperplanar guards.},

  abstract = {In this survey, we design formal verification and control algorithms for autonomous systems with practical safety guarantees using conformal prediction (CP), a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification. We focus on learning-enabled autonomous systems (LEASs) in which the complexity of learning-enabled components (LECs) is a major bottleneck that hampers the use of existing model-based verification and design techniques. Instead, we advocate for the use of CP, and we will demonstrate its use in formal verification, systems and control theory, and robotics. We argue that CP is specifically useful due to its simplicity (easy to understand, use, and modify), generality (requires no assumptions on learned models and data distributions, i.e., is distribution-free), and efficiency (real-time capable and accurate). We pursue the following goals with this survey. First, we provide an accessible introduction to CP for non-experts who are interested in using CP to solve problems in autonomy. Second, we show how to use CP for the verification of LECs, e.g., for verifying input-output properties of neural networks. Third and fourth, we review recent articles that use CP for safe control design as well as offline and online verification of LEASs. We summarize their ideas in a unifying framework that can deal with the complexity of LEASs in a computationally efficient manner. In our exposition, we consider simple system specifications, e.g., robot navigation tasks, as well as complex specifications formulated in temporal logic formalisms. Throughout our survey, we compare to other statistical techniques (e.g., scenario optimization, PAC-Bayes theory, etc.) and how these techniques have been used in verification and control. Lastly, we point the reader to open problems and future research directions.},

After introducing the notion of barrier function, we investigate sufficient conditions to guarantee different forward invariance and contractivity notions of a closed set for hybrid systems with nonuniqueness of solutions and solutions terminating prematurely. We consider forward (pre-)invariance of sets, which guarantees that the maximal solutions starting from the set stay in it, and (pre-)contractivity, which further requires that the solutions starting from the boundary of the set evolve immediately (continuously or discretely) towards its interior. Our conditions for forward invariance and contractivity are infinitesimal and in terms of the proposed barrier functions. Examples illustrate the results.}

Computer scientists use logic for testing and verification of software and digital circuits, but many computer science students study logic only in the context of traditional mathematics, encountering the subject in a few lectures and a handful of problem sets in a discrete math course. This book offers a more substantive and rigorous approach to logic that focuses on applications in computer science. Topics covered include predicate logic, equation-based software, automated testing and theorem proving, and large-scale computation. Formalism is emphasized, and the book employs three formal notations: traditional algebraic formulas of propositional and predicate logic; digital circuit diagrams; and the widely used partially automated theorem prover, ACL2, which provides an accessible introduction to mechanized formalism. For readers who want to see formalization in action, the text presents examples using Proof Pad, a lightweight ACL2 environment. Readers will not become ALC2 experts, but will learn how mechanized logic can benefit software and hardware engineers. In addition, 180 exercises, some of them extremely challenging, offer opportunities for problem solving. There are no prerequisites beyond high school algebra. Programming experience is not required to understand the book's equation-based approach. The book can be used in undergraduate courses in logic for computer science and introduction to computer science and in math courses for computer science students.},

  abstract = {Complex behaviors that can be exhibited by hybrid systems make the verification of such systems both important and challenging. Due to the infinite number of possibilities taken by the continuous state and the uncertainties in the system, exhaustive simulation is impossible, and also computing the set of reachable states is generally intractable. Nevertheless, the ever-increasing presence of hybrid systems in safety critical applications makes it evident that verification is an issue that has to be addressed. In this thesis, we develop a unified methodology for verifying temporal properties of continuous and hybrid systems. Our framework does not require explicit computation of reachable states. Instead, functions of state termed barrier certificates and density functions are used in conjunction with deductive inference to prove properties such as safety, reachability, eventuality, and their combinations. As a consequence, the proposed methods are directly applicable to systems with nonlinearity, uncertainty, and constraints. Moreover, it is possible to treat safety verification of stochastic systems in a similar fashion, by computing an upper-bound on the probability of reaching the unsafe states. We formulate verification using barrier certificates and density functions as convex programming problems. For systems with polynomial descriptions, sum of squares optimization can be used to construct polynomial barrier certificates and density functions in a computationally scalable manner. Some examples are presented to illustrate the use of the methods. At the end, the convexity of the problem formulation is also exploited to prove a converse theorem in safety verification using barrier certificates.},

Region-of-attraction approximation problems are considered for polynomial, polynomial with generalized Lur'e uncertainty, and rational trigonometric multi-rigid-body systems. Our method starts by identifying that Lagrange multipliers, traditionally heavily used for S-procedures, are a major culprit of creating bloated SOS programs. In light of this, we exploit inherent system properties-continuity, convexity, and implicit algebraic structure-and reformulate the problems as quotient-ring SOS programs, thereby eliminating all the multipliers. These new programs are smaller, sparser, less constrained, yet less conservative. Their computation is further improved by leveraging a recent result on sampling algebraic varieties. Remarkably, solution correctness is guaranteed with just a finite (in practice, very small) number of samples. Altogether, the proposed method can verify systems well beyond the reach of existing SOS-based approaches (32 states); on smaller problems where a baseline is available, it computes tighter solution 2-3 orders of magnitude faster.}

  abstract = {The design of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) requires methods and tools that can efficiently reason about the interaction between discrete models, e.g., representing the behaviors of ``cyber'' components, and continuous models of physical processes. Boolean methods such as satisfiability (SAT) solving are successful in tackling large combinatorial search problems for the design and verification of hardware and software components. On the other hand, problems in control, communications, signal processing, and machine learning often rely on convex programming as a powerful solution engine. However, despite their strengths, neither approach would work in isolation for CPSs. In this paper, we present a new satisfiability modulo convex programming (SMC) framework that integrates SAT solving and convex optimization to efficiently reason about Boolean and convex constraints at the same time. We exploit the properties of a class of logic formulas over Boolean and nonlinear real predicates, termed monotone satisfiability modulo convex formulas, whose satisfiability can be checked via a finite number of convex programs. Following the lazy satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) paradigm, we develop a new decision procedure for monotone SMC formulas, which coordinates SAT solving and convex programming to provide a satisfying assignment or determine that the formula is unsatisfiable. A key step in our coordination scheme is the efficient generation of succinct infeasibility proofs for inconsistent constraints that can support conflict-driven learning and accelerate the search. We demonstrate our approach on different CPS design problems, including spacecraft docking mission control, robotic motion planning, and secure state estimation. We show that SMC can handle more complex problem instances than state-of-the-art alternative techniques based on SMT solving and mixed integer convex programming.}

  abstract = {Hybrid systems describe the interaction of software, modeled by finite-state systems such as finite-state machines, with the physical world, described by infinite-state systems such as differential equations. Verification and Control of Hybrid Systems provides a unique systematic exposition of several classes of hybrid systems, admitting symbolic models along with the relationships between them. The text outlines several key verification and control synthesis results for hybrid systems, guided by the concept of bisimulation, and illustrated by numerous examples. The book is divided into four parts: Part I presents basic concepts centered on a notion of system that is general enough to describe finite-state, infinite-state, and hybrid systems. Part II discusses the ways in which systems relate to other systems, such as behavioral inclusion/equivalence and simulation/bisimulation, using these relationships to study verification and control synthesis problems for finite-state systems. Part III draws inspiration from timed automata to present several classes of hybrid systems, with richer continuous dynamics, that can be related to finite-state symbolic systems. Once such relationships are established, verification and control synthesis problems for these hybrid systems can be immediately solved by resorting to the techniques described in Part II for finite-state systems. Part IV follows the same strategy by generalizing simulation/bisimulation relationships to approximate simulation/bisimulation relationships that can be used for a wider class of hybrid systems. This comprehensive treatment will appeal to researchers, engineers, computer scientists, and graduate students in the areas of formal methods, verification, model checking, and control and will undoubtedly inspire further study of the specialized literature.},

  abstract = {This paper presents numerical methods for computing regions of finite-time invariance (funnels) around solutions of polynomial differential equations. The methods are compared on stabilized trajectories of a six-state model of a satellite. First, we present a method which exactly certifies sufficient conditions for invariance despite relying on approximate trajectories from numerical integration. Our second method relaxes the constraints of the first by sampling in time. On the model system, this recovered almost identical funnels but was much faster to compute. In both cases, funnels are verified using Sum-of-Squares programming to search over time-varying quadratic Lyapunov functions. We examine both time-varying rescalings of quadratic forms computed from linearizations and searching directly over time-varying quadratic Lyapunov functions. On the model system the latter provided larger funnels at the cost of increased computation time.},

In contrast to existing methods, this approach ensures safety independently of abstract high-level tasks that might be unknown or change over time. Leaving as much freedom as possible to the safe system, the authors believe that the flexibility of this approach is very promising. The design is validated using an illustrative example.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we show that under mild controllability assumptions a time-invariant Control Barrier Function (CBF) can be constructed based on predictions with a finite horizon. As a starting point, we require only a known subset of a control-invariant set where the latter set does not need to be explicitly known. We show that, based on ideas similar to the Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis, the knowledge on the subset of a control-invariant set allows us to obtain a time-invariant CBF for the time-invariant dynamics under consideration. We also provide a thorough analysis of the properties of the constructed CBF, we characterize the impact of the prediction horizon, and comment on the practical implementation. In the end, we relate our construction approach to Model Predictive Control (MPC). With a relevant application example, we demonstrate how our method is applied.}

  abstract = {This article provides a review of control protocol synthesis techniques that incorporate methodologies from formal methods and control theory to provide correctness guarantee for different types of autonomous systems, including those with discrete and continuous state space. The correctness of the system is defined with respect to a given specification expressed as a formula in linear temporal logic to precisely describe the desired properties of the system. The formalism presented in this article admits nondeterminism, allowing uncertainties in the system to be captured. A particular emphasis is on alleviating some of the difficulties, e.g., heterogeneity in the underlying dynamics and computational complexity, that naturally arise in the construction of control protocols for autonomous systems.}

  abstract = {This book presents the concept of Control Barrier Function (CBF), which captures the evolution of safety requirements during the execution of a system and can be used to enforce safety. Safety is formalized using an emerging state-of-the-art approach based on CBFs, and many illustrative examples from autonomous driving, traffic control, and robot control are provided. Safety is central to autonomous systems since they are intended to operate with minimal or no human supervision, and a single failure could result in catastrophic results. The authors discuss how safety can be guaranteed via both theoretical and application perspectives. This presented method is computationally efficient and can be easily implemented in real-time systems that require high-frequency reactive control. In addition, the CBF approach can easily deal with nonlinear models and complex constraints used in a wide spectrum of applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and traffic control. With the proliferation of autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars, mobile robots, and unmanned air vehicles, safety plays a crucial role in ensuring their widespread adoption. This book considers the integration of safety guarantees into the operation of such systems including typical safety requirements that involve collision avoidance, technological system limitations, and bounds on real-time executions. Adaptive approaches for safety are also proposed for time-varying execution bounds and noisy dynamics.},

  abstract = {Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used as an effective tool for designing a family of controls that ensures the forward invariance of a set. When multiple CBFs are present, it is important that the set of controls satisfying all the barrier conditions is non-empty. In this paper, we investigate such a control-sharing property for multiple CBFs and provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the property to hold. Based on that, we study the tracking control design problem of an input--output linearizable system with multiple time-varying output constraints, where the output constraints are encoded as CBFs and the barrier conditions are expressed as hard constraints in a quadratic program (QP) whose feasibility is guaranteed by the control-sharing property of the CBFs. With the controller generated from the QP, the output constraints are always satisfied and the tracking objective is achieved when it is not conflicting with the constraints. The effectiveness of our control design method is illustrated by two examples.}
