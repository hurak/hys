## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Write down a general format of a MLD description of a hybrid dynamical system and explain the individual terms.

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Formulate a simple hybrid system using the MLD description. For very simple systems you should be able to do it by hand but for anything more complicated feel free to use a relevant software tool.
