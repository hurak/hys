## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Explain the concept of *complementarity constraints*, both for scalar and vector variables.
- Formulate a *linear complementarity problem* (LCP).
- Give a general prescription for a *linear complementarity system* (LCS, aka linear dynamical complementarity problem, LDCP).
- Explain the essence of *time-stepping* numerical methods for simulating dynamical systems with complementarity constraints. In particular, show how the complementarity constraints are combined with an implicit or semi-explicit Euler scheme.

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Formulate a (model of a) given mechanical system with unilateral constraints (hard stops) as a linear complementarity system.
- Write a computer code (in Matlab, Julia, ...) that implements a simple time-stepping numerical scheme for a simulation of a simple mechanical system with complementarity constraints (hard stops, dry friction).
