  abstract = {This paper considers the class of deterministic continuous-time optimal control problems (OCPs) with piecewise-affine (PWA) vector field, polynomial Lagrangian and semialgebraic input and state constraints. The OCP is first relaxed as an infinite-dimensional linear program (LP) over a space of occupation measures. This LP is then approached by an asymptotically converging hierarchy of linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxations. The relaxed dual of the original LP returns a polynomial approximation of the value function that solves the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of the OCP. Based on this polynomial approximation, a suboptimal policy is developed to construct a state feedback in a sample-and-hold manner. The results show that the suboptimal policy succeeds in providing a suboptimal state feedback law that drives the system relatively close to the optimal trajectories and respects the given constraints.}

  abstract = {Piecewise affine (PWA) systems are widely used to model highly nonlinear behaviors such as contact dynamics in robot locomotion and manipulation. Existing control techniques for PWA systems have computational drawbacks, both in offline design and online implementation. In this paper, we introduce a method to obtain feedback control policies and a corresponding set of admissible initial conditions for discrete-time PWA systems such that all the closed-loop trajectories reach a goal polytope, while a cost function is optimized. The idea is conceptually similar to LQR-trees [1], which consists of 3 steps: (1) open-loop trajectory optimization, (2) feedback control for computation of ``funnels'' of states around trajectories, and (3) repeating (1) and (2) in a way that the funnels are grown backward from the goal in a tree fashion and fill the state-space as much as possible. We show PWA dynamics can be exploited to combine step (1) and (2) into a single step that is tackled using mixed-integer convex programming, which makes the method suitable for dealing with hard constraints. Illustrative examples on contact-based dynamics are presented.}

PWATOOLS is proposed to fill this gap as a software toolbox with the ability to analyze and synthesize PWA controllers for nonlinear systems. The toolbox proposed in this paper has been written to serve as an educational as well as a modeling, analysis and synthesis tool. PWATOOLS uses Yalmip, SeDuMi and PENBMI to find solutions for the sufficient conditions for stability analysis of the models or the synthesis of PWA controllers.

The authors present a unified computational methodology for the analysis and synthesis of piecewise affine controllers, taking an approach that is capable of handling sliding modes, sampled-data, and networked systems. They introduce algorithms that will be applicable to nonlinear systems approximated by piecewise affine systems, and they feature several examples from areas such as switching electronic circuits, autonomous vehicles, neural networks, and aerospace applications. Piecewise Affine Control: Continuous-Time, Sampled-Data, and Networked Systems is intended for graduate students, advanced senior undergraduate students, and researchers in academia and industry. It is also appropriate for engineers working on applications where switched linear and affine models are important. Initially proposed in view of applications to materials science, the Cahn--Hilliard equation is now applied in many other areas, including image processing, biology, ecology, astronomy, and chemistry. In particular, the author addresses applications to image inpainting and tumor growth. Many chapters include open problems and directions for future research. The Cahn--Hilliard Equation: Recent Advances and Applications is intended for graduate students and researchers in applied mathematics, especially those interested in phase separation models and their generalizations and applications to other fields.

  abstract = {This thesis treats analysis and design of piecewise linear control systems. Piecewise linear systems capture many of the most common nonlinearities in engineering systems, and they can also be used for approximation of other nonlinear systems. Several aspects of linear systems with quadratic constraints are generalized to piecewise linear systems with piecewise quadratic constraints. It is shown how uncertainty models for linear systems can be extended to piecewise linear systems, and how these extensions give insight into the classical trade-offs between fidelity and complexity of a model. Stability of piecewise linear systems is investigated using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. Piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions are much more powerful than the commonly used quadratic Lyapunov functions. It is shown how piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions can be computed via convex optimization in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The computations are based on a compact parameterization of continuous piecewise quadratic functions and conditional analysis using the S-procedure. A unifying framework for computation of a variety of Lyapunov functions via convex optimization is established based on this parameterization. Systems with attractive sliding modes and systems with bounded regions of attraction are also treated. Dissipativity analysis and optimal control problems with piecewise quadratic cost functions are solved via convex optimization. The basic results are extended to fuzzy systems, hybrid systems and smooth nonlinear systems. It is shown how Lyapunov functions with a discontinuous dependence on the discrete state can be computed via convex optimization. An automated procedure for increasing the flexibility of the Lyapunov function candidate is suggested based on linear programming duality. A Matlab toolbox that implements several of the results derived in the thesis is presented.},

His brilliance and passion for research attracted many talents. For CAS Society Leon hosted the 1974 San Francisco ISCAS and served as president in 1977. I met many distinguished visitors and many of them have become life-long colleagues- to mention a few, professor Timothy Trick of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, late professor Tamas Roska from Hungary, professor Akio Ushida of Tokushima University, Japan. It is difficult to list Leon's life-long achievements in a limited space. Here I will try to describe a subset that I have had some involvement under Leon's guidance. My own research topics included modeling of nonlinear devices and systems. The world of nonlinear circuits and systems is considered broad and Leon's research strategy was to classify and investigate particular classes of nonlinear systems. Leon's first book on nonlinear network theory [1] describes specific nonlinear systems. One of projects that I was initially worked on was on development of a canonical representation of piecewise linear functions using a combination of linear functions, absolute value functions with different breakpoints and jump discontinuities as [2]}

This representation enables the use of analysis results for systems with repeated nonlinearities based on integral quadratic constraints. This leads to a sufficient condition for L2-stability that can be checked via the solution of a single linear matrix inequality, whose dimension grows linearly with the number of basis piecewise affine functions defining the system. Numerical examples corroborate the proposed approach by providing a comparison with an alternative approach based on the computation of piecewise polynomial storage functions.}

The article describes the development of a computational tool for the analysis of piecewise linear (PL) dynamical systems. Unfortunately, many PL controllers are developed from ad hoc "intelligent systems" ideas which do not aim or allow the associated dynamic behavior to be predicted. An example of such a system is the anti-skid braking system in a car, where the controller is rule-based and designed using the engineer's knowledge of the system. The only current viable approach to testing such a system is by using extensive simulation and prototype testing, which must be repeated for each of the different car models on which it is installed. Anything that provides insight into the logic and dynamic interaction of such a system would be useful: hence the development of the work in this article. Similarly, systems with programmable logic controllers and gain schedulers also fall into the class of piecewise linear systems. The authors take ideas and known results from linear systems, convex set theory, and computational geometry and synthesize them to create an analysis tool for studying a class of systems that mix logic and dynamics. We choose to develop a computational analysis tool primarily because the traditional theoretical analysis of piecewise linear processes is intractable, except, that is, for certain local dynamic behavior.{$<>$}}

Indeed, simplifying assumptions on the sequences of modes are usually adopted, also in order to obtain averaged models and discrete-time maps. In this paper, we show how the complementarity framework can be used to represent complete switched models of a wide class of power converters, with EDs having characteristics represented by piecewise-affine (even complicated) relations. The model equations can be written in an easy and compact way without the enumeration of all converter modes, eventually formalizing the procedure to an algorithm. The complementarity model can be used to perform transient simulations and time-domain analysis. Mathematical tools coming from nonlinear programming allow to simulate numerically the transient behavior of even complex power converters. Also rigorous time-domain analysis is possible without excluding pathological situations like, for instance, inconsistent initial conditions and simultaneous switchings. Basic converter topologies are used as examples to show the construction procedure for the complementarity models and their usefulness for simulating the dynamic evolution also for nontrivial operating conditions.}

The paper addresses this problem for a class of piecewise-linear discontinuous systems under the definition of solutions of Caratheodory. The concepts of jump solutions or of sliding modes are not considered here. In this sense, the problem to be discussed is one of the most basic problems in the study of well-posedness for discontinuous dynamical systems. First, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for bimodal systems to be well-posed, in terms of an analysis based on lexicographic inequalities and the smooth continuation property of solutions. Next, its extensions to the multimodal case are discussed. As an application to switching control, in the case that two state feedback gains are switched according to a criterion depending on the state, we give a characterization of all admissible state feedback gains for which the closed loop system remains well-posed.}

The analysis and design are based on computation of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. The computations are performed using convex optimization in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).}

  abstract = {This paper presents a computational approach to stability analysis of nonlinear and hybrid systems. The search for a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function is formulated as a convex optimization problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The relation to frequency domain methods such as the circle and Popov criteria is explained. Several examples are included to demonstrate the flexibility and power of the approach.}

  abstract = {The paper describes a two-stage procedure for obtaining piecewise affine approximations of static nonlinearities obtained from measured data. In the first step we search for a suitable function which fits the data while minimizing the fitting error. Subsequently we show how to approximate, in an optimal fashion, the nonlinear fitting function by a piecewise affine function of pre-specified complexity. We illustrate that approximation of arbitrary nonlinear functions boils down to a series of one-dimensional approximations, rendering the procedure efficient from a computational point of view.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we present various algorithms both for stability and performance analysis of discrete-time piece-wise affine (PWA) systems. For stability, different classes of Lyapunov functions are considered and it is shown how to compute them through linear matrix inequalities that take into account the switching structure of the systems. We also show that the continuity of the Lyapunov function is not required in discrete time. Moreover, the tradeoff between the degree of conservativeness and computational requirements is discussed. Finally, by using arguments from the dissipativity theory for nonlinear systems, we generalize our approach to analyze the l2-gain of PWA systems.}
