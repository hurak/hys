## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Define a *reset system* as a subset of hybrid systems.
- Define a *switched/switching systems* and discuss the various mechanisms for switching.
- Define a *piecewise affine* (PWA) system.
- Enumerate and briefly explain various concepts of a solution of an ordinary differential equation (classical, extended/Carathéodory, Filippov).
- Explain the concept of a sliding mode.

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- For a simple switched system, determine if the solution qualifies as Carathéodory or Filippov.
