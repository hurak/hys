The topic of verification of hybrid systems is vast. While we only reserved a single week/chapter/block for it, it would easily fill a dedicated course, supported by a couple of books. Having a smaller time budget, we have still found some encouragement that modest introduction is feasible in the Chapter 3 of @linHybridDynamicalSystems2022. Although we are not following the book closely, we are covering some of their topics. 

Among general references for hybrid system verification, we can recommend @mitraVerifyingCyberPhysicalSystems2021. Although the book is not freely available for download, its web page contains quite some additional material such as slides and codes.
