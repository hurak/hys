In particular we prove that a real-valued function is piecewise affine [resp. piecewise linear] if both its epigraph and its hypograph are (nonconvex) polyhedral sets[resp..Polyhedral cones]. Also,We show that the collection of all piecewise affine[resp.piecewise linear] functions. Furthermore, we prove that a function is piecewise affine[resp.piecewise linear] if it can be represented as a difference of two convex [resp.,sublinear] polyhedral fucntions.}

Chua and S.M. Hang (Proc. IEEE, vol.65, no.6, p.915-29, 1977) into PWA (piecewise-affine) partitions, which arise frequently in driving-point, transfer characteristics, and state equations. Thus, a universal canonical representation that is capable of characterizing circuit equations, state equations, and driving-point and transfer characteristics of piecewise-affine circuits in a compact global analytic form has been obtained. The canonical forms developed seem to be promising tools for computational purposes as well as for analytical studies of PWA circuits.{$<>$}}

We exploit recent advances in the systematic construction of MIP formulations to derive new formulations for univariate functions using a geometric approach and for bivariate functions using a combinatorial approach. All formulations are strong, small (so-called logarithmic formulations), and have other desirable computational properties. We present extensive experiments in which they exhibit substantial computational performance improvements over existing approaches. To accompany these advanced formulations, we present PiecewiseLinearOpt, an extension of the JuMP modeling language in Julia that implements our models (alongside other formulations from the literature) through a high-level interface, hiding the complexity of the formulations from the end user.}

This new section-wise piecewise-linear representation can be easily programmed with efficient computer storage. It is a global representation in the sense that a single formula is used to compute for f(x1,x2,...,xn) for all values of (x1, x2,...., xn). Since this representation is expressed in closed analytic form, it allows standard mathematical operations and manipulations to be carried out in theorectical studies, In particular, it led to the possibility of deriving explicit closed form expressions for system parameters and design formulas. Examples are given which illustrate the potential applications of this representation in the modeling and analysis of nonlinear devices, circuits and systems.}

In consequence, the representation proposed uses the minimum number of parameters. The basis functions are obtained recursively by multiple compositions of a unique generating function /spl gamma/, resulting in several types of nested absolute-value functions. It is shown that the representation in a domain in R/sup n/ requires functions up to nesting level n. As a consequence of the choice of the basis functions, an efficient numerical method for the resolution of the parameters of the high-level (HL) canonical representation results. Finally, an application to the approximation of continuous functions is shown.}

This results in a set of base functions that can be used to compose the more general explicit description. It is shown that with this set all previously presented explicit PL descriptions can be covered. Furthermore, we pose some problems that occur when trying to construct an even more general description.{$<>$}}

  abstract = {Piecewise linear (PWL) functions are used in a variety of applications. Computing such continuous PWL functions, however, is a challenging task. Software packages and the literature on PWL function fitting are dominated by heuristic methods. This is true for both fitting discrete data points and continuous univariate functions. The only exact methods rely on nonconvex model formulations. Exact methods compute continuous PWL function for a fixed number of breakpoints minimizing some distance function between the original function and the PWL function. An optimal PWL function can only be computed if the breakpoints are allowed to be placed freely and are not fixed to a set of candidate breakpoints. In this paper, we propose the first convex model for optimal continuous univariate PWL function fitting. Dependent on the metrics chosen, the resulting formulations are either mixed-integer linear programming or mixed-integer quadratic programming problems. These models yield optimal continuous PWL functions for a set of discrete data. On the basis of these convex formulations, we further develop an exact algorithm to fit continuous univariate functions. Computational results for benchmark instances from the literature demonstrate the superiority of the proposed convex models compared with state-of-the-art nonconvex models.}
