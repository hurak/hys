Petri nets constitute a powerful and flexible framework for modelling discrete-event systems, and yet the selection of mature and well-maintained software tools is not particularly wide. How come? Petri nets have already inspired a few other frameworks such as Grafcet and SFC for PLC programming, as we discuss in the [overview of the literature](references.qmd). The "vanilla version" of Petri nets then serves mainly for academic research.

## Matlab

## Python

[SNAKES](https://snakes.ibisc.univ-evry.fr) ([github](https://github.com/fpom/snakes))

## Julia

- [Petri.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Petri.jl)
- [AlgebraicPetri.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/AlgebraicPetri.jl)
- [TimedPetriNetEditor.jl](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/TimedPetriNetEditor)

## Standalone

- [TimedPetriNetEditor](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/TimedPetriNetEditor)
- [pn-editor](https://gitlab.com/porky11/pn-editor) (It uses pnrs, a safe rust wrapper for pns written in C)
