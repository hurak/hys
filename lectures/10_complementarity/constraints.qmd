## Why complementarity constraints?

In this chapter we are going to present yet another framework for modelling hybrid systems, which comes with a rich theory and efficient algorithms. It is based on *complementarity constraints*. Before we introduce the modelling framework in the next section, we first explain the very concept of complementarity constraints and the related optimization problems.

## Definition of complementarity constraints

Two variables $x\in\mathbb R$ and $y\in\mathbb R$ satisfy the c*omplementarity constraint* if $x$ or $y$ is equal to zero and both are nonnegative 

$$xy=0, \; x\geq 0,\; y\geq 0,$$  

or, using a dedicated compact notation  
$$\boxed{0\leq x \perp y \geq 0.}$$

::: {.callout-warning}
## Both variables can be zero simultaneously
The *or* in the above definition is not exclusive, therefore it is possible that both $x$ and $y$ are zero.
:::

The concept and notation extends to vectors $x\in\mathbb R^n$ and $y\in\mathbb R^n$, in which case the constraint is interpreted componentwise
$$\boxed{\bm 0\leq \bm x \perp \bm y \geq \bm 0.}$$

## Geometric interpretation of complementarity constraints 

The set of admissible pairs $(x,y)$ in the $\mathbb R^2$ plane is constrained to the L-shaped subset given by the nonnegative $x$ and $y$ semi-axes (including the origin) as in @fig-L-shaped-complementarity-set. 

![The set of solutions satisfying a complementarity constraint](figures/l_shaped_complementarity_set.png){#fig-L-shaped-complementarity-set width=30%}

Optimization over these constraints is difficult, and not only because the feasible set is nonconvex, but also because *constraint qualification* conditions are not satisfied. Still, some results and tools are available for some classes of optimization problems with these constraints.

## Linear complementarity problem (LCP)

For a given square matrix $\mathbf M$ and a vector $\mathbf q$ , the *linear complementarity problem* (LCP) asks for finding two vectors $\bm w$ and $\bm z$ satisfying
$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \bm w-\mathbf M\bm z &= \mathbf q, \\
  \bm 0 \leq \bm w &\perp \bm z \geq \bm 0.
  \end{aligned}
$$

Just by moving all the provided data to the right-hand side we get $\bm w = \underbrace{\mathbf M\bm z + \mathbf q}_{\mathbf f(\bm z)}$ and we can write the linear complementarity constraint compactly as 
$$\boxed{
\mathbf 0 \leq \mathbf M\bm z + \mathbf q \perp \bm z \geq \mathbf 0.}
$${#eq-lcp}  

## Existence of a unique solution 

A unique solution exists for every vector $\mathbf q$ if and only if the matrix $\mathbf M$ is a P-matrix (something like positive definite, but not exactly, look it up yourself).

## LCP related to LP and QP

Note that the KKT conditions for LP and QP come in the form of LCP.

Consider the QP problem with inequality constraints
$$\text{minimize} \quad \frac{1}{2}\bm x^\top \mathbf Q \bm x + \mathbf c^\top \bm x$$ $$\text{subject to} \quad \mathbf A\bm x \geq \mathbf b,\quad \bm x\geq \mathbf 0,$$	

The KKT conditions can be written (and compare these to the conditions for the equality-constrained QP)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf 0\leq \bm x &\perp \mathbf Q\bm x - \mathbf A^\top \bm \lambda + \mathbf c \geq \mathbf 0\\
\mathbf 0\leq \bm \lambda &\perp \mathbf A\bm x -\mathbf b \geq \mathbf 0.
\end{aligned}
$$	

These can be reformatted as
$$
\mathbf 0\leq \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}\bm x\\ \bm \lambda\end{bmatrix}}_{\bm z} 
\perp
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf Q & -\mathbf A^\top \\ \mathbf A & \mathbf 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\bm x\\ \bm \lambda\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf c \\ -\mathbf b \end{bmatrix}}_{\mathbf M\bm z+\mathbf q}\geq 0.$$ 

## Nonlinear complementarity problem (NLCP)

Recall that when deriving @eq-lcp, we denoted the right-hand side by $\mathbf f(\bm x)$. The motivation for this was to help define a general nonlinear complementarity problem (NLCP): given a vector function $\mathbf f: \mathbb R^n\rightarrow \mathbb R^n$, find a vector $\bm x\in\mathbb R^n$ satisfying
$$\boxed{
\bm 0\leq \bm x \perp \mathbf f(\bm x) \geq \bm 0.}
$${#eq-nlcp}

## Mixed complementarity problem (MCP) 

We now provide an extension of a complementarity constraint to the situation in which the variable $x$ is lower- and upper-bounded. In particular, it can be stated as
$$\boxed{
  l \leq x \leq u \perp f(x),} 
$${#eq-mcp}

where $l$ and $u$ are vectors of lower and upper bounds, respectively, and $f(x)$ is a vector function
which reads that 

- if $x$ is strictly within the interval, that is, $l < x < u$ , then $f(x)=0$,
- if $x= l$ , then $f(x)\geq 0$,
- if $x= u$ , then $f(x)\leq 0$,

with elementwise interpretation in the vector case.

## Extensions and related problems

LCP and MCP are all we need in our course, but let's mentions some extensions and related problems. 

### Extended linear complementarity problem (ELCP) 

Given some matrices $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$ , vectors $\mathbf c$ and $\mathbf d$ , and $m$ subsets $\phi_j \sub \{1,2,\ldots,p\}$ , find a vector $\bm x$ such that
$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \sum_{j=1}^m\prod_{i\in\phi_j}(\mathbf A\bm x - \mathbf c)_i &= 0,\\
  \mathbf A\bm x &\geq \mathbf c,\\
  \mathbf B\bm x &= \mathbf d,
  \end{aligned}
$$  
or show that no such $\bm x$ exists.

The first equation is equivalent to 
$$
\forall j \in \{1, \ldots, m\} \; \exist i \in \phi_j \;\text{such that} \; (\mathbf A\bm x âˆ’ \mathbf c)_i = 0.
$$

Geometric interpretation: union of some faces of a polyhedron.

### Mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC)

The mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) is 
$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \operatorname*{minimize}_{\bm x\in\mathbb R^n} & \;f(\bm x)\\
  \text{subject to} & \;\mathbf 0\leq \mathbf h(\bm x) \perp \mathbf g(\bm x) \geq \mathbf 0.
  \end{aligned}
$$

It is a special case of *Mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC)*.

### Mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC)

Optimization problem in which some variable should satisfy equilibrium constraints:
$$
  \begin{aligned}
  \operatorname*{minimize}_{x_1,x_2} &\; f(x_1,x_2)\\
  \text{subject to}&\; \nabla_{x_2} \phi(x_1,x_2) = 0.
  \end{aligned}
$$

For convex $\phi()$ it can be reformulated into a *Bilevel optimization* problem.

### Bilevel optimization

Optimization problem in which some variables are constrained to be results of some inner optimization.
In the simplest form
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \operatorname*{minimize}_{x_1,x_2} &\; f(x_1,x_2)\\
  \text{subject to}\ &\; x_2 = \text{arg}\,\min_{x_2} \;\phi(x_1,x_2).
\end{aligned}
$$

### Disjunctive constraints

Disjunctive constraints are given by a number of conditions induced by affine constraints and connected with $\lor$ and $\land$ logical operators

$$
T_1 \lor T_2 \lor \ldots \lor T_m,
$$
where 
$$
T_i = T_{i1} \land T_{i1} \land \ldots \land T_{in_{i}},
$$ 
where 
$$
T_{ij} = \left[\mathbf c_{ij}\bm x + \mathbf d_{ij} \in \mathcal D_{ij}\right].
$$

The connection of disjunctive constraints with complementarity constraints is straightforward:

$$
\underbrace{(x\geq 0)}_{T_{11}} \land \underbrace{(xy = 0)}_{T_{12}} \land \underbrace{(y\geq 0)}_{T_{13}}. 
$$

### Variational inequality (VI)

Given a set $\mathcal K$ and a function $F: \mathcal K \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$, find a vector $\bm x\in\mathcal K$ such that
$$
\langle \mathbf F(\bm x), \bm y-\bm x \rangle \geq 0 \quad \forall \bm y\in\mathcal K.
$$

If $\mathbf F(\bm x) = \nabla f(\bm x)$ , VI is a convex optimization problem, that is, the problem of finding a vector $\bm x\in\mathcal K$ such that

$$
\langle \nabla f(\bm x), \bm y-\bm x \rangle \geq 0 \quad \forall \bm y\in\mathcal K.
$$	

But there may also be $\mathbf F(\bm x)$ that is not the gradient of any function $f(\bm x)$. In this regards, VI is a broader class of problems than convex optimization.

The reason why we include this problem class here is that if $\mathcal K$ is a nonnegative orthant $\mathbb R_{++}^n$, that is, $x_i \geq 0, \; i=1, \ldots, n$ , then the VI specializes to finding $\bm x\geq \mathbf 0$ such that
$$
\langle \mathbf F(\bm x), \bm y-\bm x \rangle \geq 0 \quad \forall \bm y\geq \mathbf 0, 
$$
and it can be shown that it is equivalent to the NCP or LCP, depending on $\mathbf F()$.

::: {.proof}
For $\bm y=\bm 0$, we get $\langle \mathbf F(\bm x), -\bm x \rangle \geq 0$, which is equivalent to $\langle \mathbf F(\bm x), \bm x \rangle \leq 0$. For $\bm y = 2\bm x$, we get $\langle \mathbf F(\bm x), \bm x \rangle \geq 0$. Reconciling the two inequalities, we get $\langle \mathbf F(\bm x), \bm x \rangle = 0$. Invoking the linearity of the inner product, we get $\langle \mathbf F(\bm x), \bm y-\bm x \rangle = \langle \mathbf F(\bm x), \bm y\rangle \geq 0 \; \forall \bm y\geq \mathbf 0$, from which it follows that $\mathbf F(\bm x)\geq 0$.
:::


Similarly, if $\mathcal K$ is a "box" in $\mathbb R^n$, that is, $-\infty\leq l_i \leq x_i \leq u_i\leq \infty, \; i=1, \ldots, n$, then VI is equivalent to the MCP. #TODO: sketch the explanation, if not a full proof.
