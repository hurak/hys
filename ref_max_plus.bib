This sets the ground on which a theory of these systems can be developed in a manner which is very analogous to that of conventional linear system theory. Some preliminary basic developments in that direction are shown. Several ways in which one can consider event graphs as linear systems are described. These correspond to approaches in the time domain, in the event domain, and in a two-dimensional domain. In each of these approaches, a different algebra has to be used for models to remain linear, but the common feature of these algebras is that they all fall into the axiomatic definition of 'dioids'. A unified presentation of basic algebraic results on dioids is provided.}

  abstract = {A discrete-event system is a system whose behavior can be described by means of a set of time-consuming activities, performed according to a prescribed ordering. Events correspond to starting or ending some activity. An analogy between linear systems and a class of discrete-event systems is developed. Following this analogy, such discrete-event systems can be viewed as linear, in the sense of an appropriate algebra. The periodical behavior of closed discrete-event systems, i.e., involving a set of repeatedly performed activities, can be totally characterized by solving an eigenvalue and eigenvector equation in this algebra. This problem is numerically solved by an efficient algorithm which basically consists of finding the shortest paths from one node to all other nodes in a graph. The potentiality of this approach for the performance evaluation of flexible manufacturing systems is emphasized; the case of a flowshop-like production process is analyzed in detail.}

How do mathematicians then calculate a railroad timetable that accurately reflects their comings and goings? One approach is to use max-plus algebra, a framework used to model Discrete Event Systems, which are well suited to describe the ordering and timing of events. This is the first textbook on max-plus algebra, providing a concise and self-contained introduction to the topic. Applications of max-plus algebra abound in the world around us. Traffic systems, computer communication systems, production lines, and flows in networks are all based on discrete even systems, and thus can be conveniently described and analyzed by means of max-plus algebra. The book consists of an introduction and thirteen chapters in three parts. Part One explores the introduction of max-plus algebra and of system descriptions based upon it. Part Two deals with a real application, namely the design of timetables for railway networks. Part Three examines various extensions, such as stochastic systems and min-max-plus systems. The text is suitable for last-year undergraduates in mathematics, and each chapter provides exercises, notes, and a reference section.},

Combined use of timed event graphs and Min-Plus algebra is a well-known approach and efficient for handling timed behavior and mathematical modelling of discrete event systems. However, in current literature, many of control approaches assume that system states are fully observable, which is not the case in our study. Hence, we propose in this paper a feedback control method to guarantee the respect of marking constraints imposed for some paths of partially observable timed event graphs. We demonstrate that if each loop of the considered TEG contains at last one observable transition, we can derive a realisable control law satisfying a set of constraints.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss a modeling framework for model predictive scheduling of a class of semi-cyclic discrete event systems that can be described by switching max-plus linear models. We study the structure of the system matrices and derive how routing, ordering, and synchronization can be manipulated by a set of control variables. In addition, we show that this leads to a system matrix that is linear in the control variables. We define the model predictive scheduling design problem to optimize the schedule, and we show that the problem can be recast as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem.}

  abstract = {In this paper we consider the modelling and control of discrete event systems using switching max-plus-linear systems. In switching max-plus-linear systems we can switch between different modes of operation. In each mode the discrete event system is described by a max-plus-linear state space model with different system matrices for each mode. The switching allows us to change the structure of the system, to break synchronization and to change the order of events. We will give some examples of this type of systems. We define the model predictive control design problem for this type of discrete event system, and we show that solving this problem in general leads to a mixed integer optimization problem.},

  abstract = {This chapter considers the problem of designing an model predictive controller (MPC) for the class of max-plus linear (MPL) discrete event systems and gives and extensive overview of the results. It considers the case where the input, output and state sequence must satisfy a set of linear inequality constraints. The chapter discusses the background in MPC for time-driven systems and gives some basic results in max-plus algebra and MPL systems. It gives an analytic expression for the controller and provides sufficient conditions for stability. The chapter analyses the performance of the MPC controller. It treats robust MPC in the case of perturbed operation due to modelling errors and/or noise. The chapter also considers both the bounded perturbation case and the stochastic perturbation case. It shows that under quite general conditions, the resulting optimization problems can be solved very efficiently.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control for max-plus linear discrete-event systems usually leads to a nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problem with real valued variables, which may be hard to solve efficiently. An alternative approach is to transform the given problem into a mixed integer linear programming problem. However, the computational complexity of current mixed integer linear programming algorithms increases in the worst case exponentially as a function of the prediction horizon. The focus of this paper is on making optimistic optimization suited to solve the given problem. Optimistic optimization is a class of algorithms that can find an approximation of the global optimum for general nonlinear optimization. A key advantage of optimistic optimization is that one can specify the computational budget in advance and guarantee bounds on the suboptimality with respect to the global optimum. We prove that optimistic optimization can be applied for the given problem by developing a dedicated semi-metric and by proving it satisfies the necessary requirements for optimistic optimization. Moreover, we show that the complexity of optimistic optimization is exponential in the control horizon instead of the prediction horizon. Hence, using optimistic optimization is more efficient when the control horizon is small and the prediction horizon is large.},
