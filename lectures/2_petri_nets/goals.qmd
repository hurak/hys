## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Enumerate and explain the components of a *Petri net* (graph).
- Show how to encode the state of a system modelled by a Petri net (graph).
- Write down a general form of state transition equations for a Petri net.
- Explain how the untimed Petri net needs to be modified to model a timed discrete-event system.

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Create a model of a simple queueing system in the form of a Petri net.
- Find the firing times for transitions in a (simple) timed Petri net.
