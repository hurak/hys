The main resource for us is the Chapter 17 of the freely available book @borrelliPredictiveControlLinear2017 that we already referred to in the previous chapter.

Those who have not been exposed to fundamentals of MPC can check the Chapter 12 in the same book. Alternatively, our own introduction to the topic in the third chapter/week of the [Optimal and robust control course](https://hurak.github.io/orr/) can be found useful.
