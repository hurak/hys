## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Give a definition of a *hybrid automaton*. In particular, describe all the key components. 
- Draws a graph of a hybrid automaton that displays all the key types of components.
- Explain the differences in roles played in a hybrid automaton by the *invariant* (or *domain*) of a given *location* (or *mode*), and the *guard set* of a given transition. 

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Find a model of a simple dynamical system in the form of a hybrid automaton.
- Implement a simple hybrid automaton in Stateflow.
