## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Formulate the MPC problem for a hybrid dynamical system modelled using a MLD description. Consider not only the quadratic cost but also costs built using 1- and infinity norms.

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Formulate and solve an MPC problem using a MILP or MIQP solver using Hybrid Toolbox.
