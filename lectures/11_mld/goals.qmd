## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Explain how logical conditions can be translated into linear inequalities using binary variables.
- Write down the general form of a *mixed logical dynamical* (MLD) description of a hybrid dynamical system and explain the individual terms.

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Formulate the MLD description of a simple discrete-time hybrid automaton. For very simple systems you should be able to do it by hand but for anything more complicated feel free to use a relevant software tool.
