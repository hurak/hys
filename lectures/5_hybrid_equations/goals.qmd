## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Explain the key components of *hybrid (state) equations* (also *flow-event* equations, also *flow-jump* equations).

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Find a model of a simple dynamical system in the form of hybrid equations, that is, determine the four components of hybrid equations.
- Implement a model in the form of hybrid equations using the free HyEQ Toolbox for Matlab.
