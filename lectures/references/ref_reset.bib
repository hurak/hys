  abstract = {Impulsive dynamical systems is a well-established area of dynamical systems theory, and it is used in this work to analyse several basic properties of reset control systems: existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous dependence on the initial condition (well-posedness). The work scope is about reset control systems with a linear and time-invariant base system, and a zero-crossing resetting law. A necessary and sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness of solutions, based on the well-posedness of reset instants, is developed. As a result, it is shown that reset control systems (with strictly proper plants) do not have Zeno solutions. It is also shown that full reset and partial reset (with a special structure) always produce well-posed reset instants. Moreover, a definition of continuous dependence on the initial condition is developed, and also a sufficient condition for reset control systems to satisfy that property. Finally, this property is used to analyse sensitivity of reset control systems to sensor noise. This work also includes a number of illustrative examples motivating the key concepts and main results.}

  abstract = {Reset control systems are a special type of impulsive hybrid systems in which the time evolution depends both on continuous dynamics between resets and the discrete dynamics corresponding to the reset instants. In this work, stability of reset control systems is approached by using an equivalent (time-varying) discrete time system, introducing new sufficient stability conditions that explicitly depend on the reset times. The stability conditions overcome previous results such as the -condition and can be also applied to reset systems with unstable base system. In addition, stabilization of reset control systems is approached for systems with stable base system, resulting in that a reset control system can be always stabilized if reset intervals are forced to be large enough, avoiding resets at some crossings if necessary.}

Moreover, robustness to an unknown static friction level and an unknown Stribeck contribution is guaranteed. The closed-loop dynamics are formulated in a hybrid systems framework, using a novel hybrid description of the static friction element, and the asymptotic stability of the setpoint is proven accordingly. The working principle of the controller is demonstrated experimentally on a motion stage of an electron microscope, showing superior performance over classical PID control.}

It gives a testable necessary and sufficient condition for quadratic stability and links it to both uniform bounded-input bounded-state stability and steady-state performance.

  abstract = {The ever-increasing industry desire for improved performance makes linear controller design run into fundamental limitations. Nonlinear control methods such as Reset Control (RC) are needed to overcome these. RC is a promising candidate since, unlike other nonlinear methods, it easily integrates into the industry-preferred PID design framework. Thus far, RC has been analysed in the frequency domain either through describing function analysis or by direct closed-loop numerical computation. The former computes a simplified closed-loop RC response by assuming a sufficient low-pass behaviour. In doing so it ignores all harmonics, which literature has found to cause significant modelling prediction errors. The latter gives a precise solution, but by its direct closed-loop computation does not clearly show how open-loop RC design translates to closed-loop performance. The main contribution of this work is aimed at overcoming these limitations by considering an alternative approach for modelling RC using state-dependent impulse inputs. This permits accurately computing closed-loop RC behaviour starting from the underlying linear system, improving system understanding. A frequency-domain description for closed-loop RC is obtained, which is solved analytically by using several well-defined assumptions. This analytical solution is verified using a simulated high-precision stage, critically examining sources of modelling errors. The accuracy of the proposed method is further substantiated using controllers designed for various specifications.}

The HIGS keeps the sign of its input and output equal, thereby inducing less phase lag than a linear integrator, much like the famous Clegg integrator. The HIGS achieves the reduced phase lag by projection of the controller dynamics instead of using resets of the integrator state, which forms a potential benefit of this control element. To formally analyze HIGS-controlled systems, we present an appropriate mathematical framework for describing these novel systems. Based on this framework, HIGS-controlled systems are proven to be well-posed in the sense of existence and forward completeness of solutions. Moreover, we propose two approaches for analyzing (input-to-state) stability of the resulting nonlinear closed-loop systems: (i) circle-criterion-like conditions based on (measured) frequency response data, and (ii) LMI-based conditions exploiting a new construction of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. A motion control example is used to illustrate the results.}

Firstly, in order to quantify stability of reset control systems, we propose an approach which does not rely on the stability of base linear systems. Based on this, some Lie-algebraic conditions for stability of reset control systems are obtained. Then, we develop a method for reset law design which aims at improving transient responses of the base linear systems. In addition, observer-based design is also considered. We prove that under some mild conditions, reset controller and observer can be designed separately. The obtained results are applied to short-span-seeking control of a kind of single stage hard disk drive servo systems. Simulations show that the proposed design is much more capable of improving transient response than traditional control design techniques.}

In the computer-based implementation, however, the continuous triggering signal is sampled and the triggering condition is then replaced by a discrete-time counterpart. In this work, we are concerned with the stability analysis and design of reset control systems based directly on discrete-time triggering conditions. First, a relationship between reset control systems and switched systems is established and some stability criteria are then obtained. Second, it is revealed through an example that a well-designed reset control system can be regarded as a hybrid system combining an underdamped baseline system with an overdamped reset mode. The reset matrix, which is assumed to be zero in general, can be adjusted to increase the damping ratio and thus further improve the transient performance. Based on this observation, a design guideline for single-input and single-output (SISO) systems is proposed. Lastly, a hard disk drive example is investigated to demonstrate the proposed design procedure.}

Reset controllers are linear controllers that reset some of their states to zero when their inputs reach a threshold. Horowitz motivated their use by showing that with qualitative design, they can exhibit better performance trade-offs than those in linear, time-invariant systems.

A new architecture for reset elements will be introduced which has a continuous output signal as opposed to conventional reset elements. A steady-state precision study is presented, showing the steady-state precision is preserved while the peak of sensitivity is reduced. The architecture is then used for a ``Constant in Gain Lead in Phase'' (CgLp) element and a numerical analysis on transient response shows a significant improvement in transient response. It is shown that by following the presented guideline for tuning, settling time can be reduced and at the same time a non-overshoot step response can be achieved. A practical example is presented to verify the results and also to show that the proposed element can achieve a complex-order behaviour.}

  abstract = {In the design of a linear feedback system to achieve prescribed response tolerances despite significant plant uncertainty, the principal price paid is in the amplification of sensor noise, which tends to saturate the plant elements. This noise amplification is due to the fixed relation between gain and phase of an analytic function, which forces relatively slow reduction of the loop transmission magnitude, as a function of frequency. A nonlinear element, the Clegg Integrator (C.I.), is used to alleviate this relation, permitting faster reduction of the loop transmission magnitude. The major difficulty is in finding a description of C.I. usable for synthesis. This is done by considering the class of step inputs, and locating the C.I. such that, from the inputs and the system output specifications, the nature of the inputs to the C.I. is known, permitting an equivalent linear characterization. A quantitative design procedure is then available to precisely design to achieve specified tolerances. A design example is included illustrating the superior features of the non-linear system, for a specific input class.}

  abstract = {The ever-growing demands on speed and precision from the precision motion industry have pushed control requirements to reach the limitations of linear control theory. Nonlinear controllers like reset provide a viable alternative since they can be easily integrated into the existing linear controller structure and designed using industry-preferred loop-shaping techniques. However, currently, loop-shaping is achieved using the describing function (DF) and performance analysed using linear control sensitivity functions not applicable for reset control systems, resulting in a significant deviation between expected and practical results. This major bottleneck to the wider adaptation of reset control is overcome in this paper with two important contributions. First, an extension of frequency-domain tools for reset controllers in the form of higher-order sinusoidal-input describing functions (HOSIDFs) is presented, providing greater insight into their behaviour. Second, a novel method that uses the DF and HOSIDFs of the open-loop reset control system for the estimation of the closed-loop sensitivity functions is proposed, establishing for the first time --- the relation between open-loop and closed-loop behaviour of reset control systems in the frequency domain. The accuracy of the proposed solution is verified in both simulation and practice on a precision positioning stage and these results are further analysed to obtain insights into the tuning considerations for reset controllers.}

  abstract = {Ever-decreasing track width to nanometer level becomes a great challenge for servo systems to fulfill short-span seeking and track-following in hard-disk drives (HDDs). This paper utilizes the reset integral-derivative element (RIDE), an integral-derivative controller whose states are set to zero when its input is zero, in both single- and dual-stage HDD servo systems. The RIDE can reduce the overshoot of step response, which will speed up the short-span seeking operation. Furthermore, the capability to suppress output disturbances in track-following is also found to be improved. Compared with linear control methods for short-span seeking, our results show that the merits of reset design are the simpleness in implementation and the robustness to plant uncertainties}

  abstract = {We revisit a class of reset control systems containing first order reset elements (FORE) and Clegg integrators and propose a new class of models for these systems. The proposed model generalizes the models available in the literature and we illustrate, using the Clegg integrator, that it is more appropriate for describing the behavior of reset systems. Then, we state computable sufficient conditions for L/sub 2/ stability of the new class of models. Our results are based on LMIs and they exploit quadratic and piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. Finally, a result on stabilization of linear minimum phase systems with relative degree one using high gain FOREs is stated. We present two examples to illustrate our results. In particular, we show that for some systems a FORE can achieve lower L/sub 2/ gain than the underlying linear controller without resets.}

  abstract = {Using the describing function method, engineers in the 1950s and 1960s conceived of novel nonlinear compensators in an attempt to overcome performance limitations inherent in linear time-invariant (LTI) control systems. This paper is concerned with a subset of such devices called ``reset controllers'', which are LTI systems equipped with mechanisms and laws to reset their states to zero. This paper reports on a design procedure and a laboratory experiment, the first to be reported in the literature, in which the resulting reset controller provides better design tradeoffs than LTI compensation. Specifically, it is shown that reset control increases the level of sensor-noise suppression without sacrificing either disturbance-rejection performance or gain/phase margins.}
