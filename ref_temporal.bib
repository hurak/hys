  abstract = {The name "temporal logic" may sound complex and daunting; but while they describe potentially complex scenarios, temporal logics are often based on a few simple, and fundamental, concepts - highlighted in this book. An Introduction to Practical Formal Methods Using Temporal Logic provides an introduction to formal methods based on temporal logic, for developing and testing complex computational systems. These methods are supported by many well-developed tools, techniques and results that can be applied to a wide range of systems. Fisher begins with a full introduction to the subject, covering the basics of temporal logic and using a variety of examples, exercises and pointers to more advanced work to help clarify and illustrate the topics discussed. He goes on to describe how this logic can be used to specify a variety of computational systems, looking at issues of linking specifications, concurrency, communication and composition ability. He then analyses temporal specification techniques such as deductive verification, algorithmic verification, and direct execution to develop and verify computational systems. The final chapter on case studies analyses the potential problems that can occur in a range of engineering applications in the areas of robotics, railway signalling, hardware design, ubiquitous computing, intelligent agents, and information security, and explains how temporal logic can improve their accuracy and reliability.     Models temporal notions and uses them to analyze computational systems     Provides a broad approach to temporal logic across many formal methods - including specification, verification and implementation     Introduces and explains freely available tools based on temporal logics and shows how these can be applied     Presents exercises and pointers to further study in each chapter, as well as an accompanying website providing links to additional systems based upon temporal logic as well as additional material related to the book.},

  abstract = {Discrete-time stochastic systems are an essential modeling tool for many engineering systems. We consider stochastic control systems that are evolving over continuous spaces. For this class of models, methods for the formal verification and synthesis of control strategies are computationally hard and generally rely on the use of approximate abstractions. Building on approximate abstractions, we compute control strategies with lower- and upper-bounds for satisfying unbounded temporal logic specifications. First, robust dynamic programming mappings over the abstract system are introduced to solve the control synthesis and verification problem. These mappings yield a control strategy and a unique lower bound on the satisfaction probability for temporal logic specifications that is robust to the incurred approximation errors. Second, upper-bounds on the satisfaction probability are quantified, and properties of the mappings are analyzed and discussed. Finally, we show the implications of these results to continuous state space of linear stochastic dynamic systems. This abstraction-based synthesis framework is shown to be able to handle infinite-horizon properties. Approximation errors expressed as deviations in the outputs of the models and as deviations in the probabilistic transitions are allowed and are quantified using approximate stochastic simulation relations.}

We show that, by checking the approximation directions of each state set in the temporal logic tree, we can check if the temporal logic tree suffers from the "leaking corner issue," where the intersection of reachable sets yields an incorrect approximation. By ensuring a temporal logic tree has no leaking corners, we know the temporal logic tree correctly verifies the existence of control policies that satisfy the specified task. After confirming the existence of control policies, we show that we can leverage the value functions obtained through Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis to efficiently compute the set of control inputs the CPS can implement throughout the deployment time horizon to guarantee the completion of the specified task. Finally, we use a newly released Python toolbox to evaluate the presented approach on a simulated driving task.},

First, we partition the state space in accordance with the predicates in the formula, and construct a transition system over the partition quotient, which captures our capability of designing controllers.

Although, developing a full feedback control system is beyond the scope of this paper, authors believe that a feedback loop can be easily introduced by adopting the receding horizon scheme of predictive controllers.

  abstract = {Abstraction-based, hierarchical approaches to control synthesis from temporal logic specifications for dynamical systems have gained increased popularity over the last decade. Yet various issues commonly encountered and extensively dealt with in control systems have not been adequately discussed in the context of temporal logic control of dynamical systems, such as inter-sample behaviors of a sampled-data system, effects of imperfect state measurements and un-modeled dynamics, and the use of time-discretized models to design controllers for continuous-time dynamical systems. We discuss these issues in this paper. The main motivation is to demonstrate the possibility of accounting for the mismatches between a continuous-time control system and its various types of abstract models used for control synthesis. We do this by incorporating additional robustness measures in the abstract models. Such robustness measures are gained at the price of either increased non-determinism in the abstracted models or relaxed versions of the specification being realized. Under a unified notion of abstraction, we provide concrete means of incorporating these robustness measures and establish results that demonstrate their effectiveness in dealing with the above mentioned issues.},

The main results of this paper demonstrate that the robustness margins can effectively account for the mismatches between a control system and its finite abstractions used for control synthesis. The quantitative nature of the robustness margins also makes it possible to study the trade-offs between the performance of controllers and their robustness against various types of adversaries (e.g., delays, measurement errors, or modeling uncertainties). We use a simple adaptive cruise control (ACC) example to illustrate such robustness--performance trade-offs.},

MTL is a popular logic that allows to specify timed properties of real-time reactive systems and hence is appropriate for describing the safe and autonomous operations of robotic systems in an uncertain and possibly adversarial environment. We provide constructive means for computing finite-state abstractions that preserve MTL properties for nonlinear systems, under a weak assumption that these nonlinear systems evolve continuously with respect to their initial conditions. We then provide conditions to ensure that the existence of a discrete strategy (obtained by solving a discrete synthesis problem) guarantees the existence of a switching strategy for controlling the continuous-time dynamical systems to satisfy a given MTL specification. We illustrate the results on a motion planning problem.}

Based on the verification of the LTL specification, an abstraction-based control design approach is proposed in this paper: a novel abstraction construction is developed first, then finite local abstract controllers are designed to achieve the LTL specification, and finally the designed abstract controllers are combined and refined as the controller for the original system.

Our approach is based on two main steps. First, we construct an abstraction for the motion of the vehicle in the environment by using input--output linearization and assignment of vector fields to the regions in the partition. Second, a receding horizon controller computes local plans within the sensing range of the vehicle such that both local and global mission specifications are satisfied.

The resulting embedded control software consists of a goal generator, a trajectory planner, and a continuous controller. The goal generator essentially reduces the trajectory generation problem to a sequence of smaller problems of short horizon while preserving the desired system-level temporal properties. Subsequently, in each iteration, the trajectory planner solves the corresponding short-horizon problem with the currently observed state as the initial state and generates a feasible trajectory to be implemented by the continuous controller. Based on the simulation property, we show that the composition of the goal generator, trajectory planner and continuous controller and the corresponding receding horizon framework guarantee the correctness of the system. To handle failures that may occur due to a mismatch between the actual system and its model, we propose a response mechanism and illustrate, through an example, how the system is capable of responding to certain failures and continues to exhibit a correct behavior.},

  abstract = {We present a methodology for automatic synthesis of embedded control software that incorporates a class of linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications sufficient to describe a wide range of properties including safety, stability, progress, obligation, response and guarantee. To alleviate the associated computational complexity of LTL synthesis, we propose a receding horizon framework that effectively reduces the synthesis problem into a set of smaller problems. The proposed control structure consists of a goal generator, a trajectory planner, and a continuous controller. The goal generator reduces the trajectory generation problem into a sequence of smaller problems of short horizon while preserving the desired system-level temporal properties. Subsequently, in each iteration, the trajectory planner solves the corresponding short-horizon problem with the currently observed state as the initial state and generates a feasible trajectory to be implemented by the continuous controller. Based on the simulation property, we show that the composition of the goal generator, trajectory planner and continuous controller and the corresponding receding horizon framework guarantee the correctness of the system with respect to its specification regardless of the environment in which the system operates. In addition, we present a response mechanism to handle failures that may occur due to a mismatch between the actual system and its model. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through an example of an autonomous vehicle navigating an urban environment. This example also illustrates that the system is not only robust with respect to exogenous disturbances but is also capable of properly handling violation of the environment assumption that is explicitly stated as part of the system specification.}

  abstract = {This paper describes TuLiP, a Python-based software toolbox for the synthesis of embedded control software that is provably correct with respect to an expressive subset of linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. TuLiP combines routines for (1) finite state abstraction of control systems, (2) digital design synthesis from LTL specifications, and (3) receding horizon planning. The underlying digital design synthesis routine treats the environment as adversary; hence, the resulting controller is guaranteed to be correct for any admissible environment profile. TuLiP applies the receding horizon framework, allowing the synthesis problem to be broken into a set of smaller problems, and consequently alleviating the computational complexity of the synthesis procedure, while preserving the correctness guarantee.},

  abstract = {We present a computational framework for automatic synthesis of a feedback control strategy for a discrete-time piecewise affine (PWA) system from a specification given as a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula over an arbitrary set of linear predicates in the system's state variables. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, by defining appropriate partitions for its state and input spaces, we construct a finite abstraction of the PWA system in the form of a control transition system. Second, by leveraging ideas and techniques from LTL model checking and Rabin games, we develop an algorithm to generate a control strategy for the finite abstraction. While provably correct and robust to state measurements and small perturbations in the applied inputs, the overall procedure is conservative and expensive. The proposed algorithms have been implemented as a software package and made available for download. Illustrative examples are included.}
