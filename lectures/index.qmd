This website constitutes the (work-in-progress) lecture notes for the graduate course on Hybrid Systems ([B3M35HYS](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/cz/education/bk/predmety/67/72/p6772006.html), [BE3M35HYS](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/en/education/bk/predmety/68/41/p6841906.html)) taught within [Cybernetics and Robotics](https://kyr.fel.cvut.cz) graduate program at [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](https://fel.cvut.cz), [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://cvut.cz), Czechia. 

Each chapter corresponds to a single weekly block (covered by a lecture, a seminar/exercise, and some homework), hence 13 chapters in total.

Although most of the material needed for the course is here, occassionally we may refer the officially enrolled students to the course page within the [FEL Moodle](https://moodle.fel.cvut.cz) system for some other material.
