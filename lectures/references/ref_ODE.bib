  abstract = {Designed for those people who want to gain a practical knowledge of modern techniques, this book contains all the material necessary for a course on the numerical solution of differential equations. Written by two of the field's leading authorities, it provides a unified presentation of initial value and boundary value problems in ODEs as well as differential-algebraic equations. The approach is aimed at a thorough understanding of the issues and methods for practical computation while avoiding an extensive theorem-proof type of exposition. It also addresses reasons why existing software succeeds or fails. This is a practical and mathematically well informed introduction that emphasizes basic methods and theory, issues in the use and development of mathematical software, and examples from scientific engineering applications. Topics requiring an extensive amount of mathematical development are introduced, motivated, and included in the exercises, but a complete and rigorous mathematical presentation is referenced rather than included.},

  abstract = {Methods for the numerical simulation of dynamic mathematical models have been the focus of intensive research for well over 60 years, and the demand for better and more efficient methods has grown as the range of applications has increased. Mathematical models involving evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) as well as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arise in diverse applications such as fluid flow, image processing and computer vision, physics-based animation, mechanical systems, relativity, earth sciences, and mathematical finance. This textbook develops, analyzes, and applies numerical methods for evolutionary, or time-dependent, differential problems. Both PDEs and ODEs are discussed from a unified viewpoint. The author emphasizes finite difference and finite volume methods, specifically their principled derivation, stability, accuracy, efficient implementation, and practical performance in various fields of science and engineering. Smooth and nonsmooth solutions for hyperbolic PDEs, parabolic-type PDEs, and initial value ODEs are treated, and a practical introduction to geometric integration methods is included as well. Audience: suitable for researchers and graduate students from a variety of fields including computer science, applied mathematics, physics, earth and ocean sciences, and various engineering disciplines. Researchers who simulate processes that are modeled by evolutionary differential equations will find material on the principles underlying the appropriate method to use and the pitfalls that accompany each method.},

  abstract = {A Concise Introduction to Geometric Numerical Integration presents the main themes, techniques, and applications of geometric integrators for researchers in mathematics, physics, astronomy, and chemistry who are already familiar with numerical tools for solving differential equations. It also offers a bridge from traditional training in the numerical analysis of differential equations to understanding recent, advanced research literature on numerical geometric integration. The book first examines high-order classical integration methods from the structure preservation point of view. It then illustrates how to construct high-order integrators via the composition of basic low-order methods and analyzes the idea of splitting. It next reviews symplectic integrators constructed directly from the theory of generating functions as well as the important category of variational integrators. The authors also explain the relationship between the preservation of the geometric properties of a numerical method and the observed favorable error propagation in long-time integration. The book concludes with an analysis of the applicability of splitting and composition methods to certain classes of partial differential equations, such as the Schr{\"o}dinger equation and other evolution equations. The motivation of geometric numerical integration is not only to develop numerical methods with improved qualitative behavior but also to provide more accurate long-time integration results than those obtained by general-purpose algorithms. Accessible to researchers and post-graduate students from diverse backgrounds, this introductory book gets readers up to speed on the ideas, methods, and applications of this field. Readers can reproduce the figures and results given in the text using the MATLAB{\textregistered} programs and model files available online.},

The beginning of each chapter is of introductory nature, followed by practical applications, the discussion of numerical results, theoretical investigations on the order and accuracy, linear and nonlinear stability, convergence and asymptotic expansions. Stiff and differential-algebraic problems arise everywhere in scientific computations (e.g. in physics, chemistry, biology, control engineering, electrical network analysis, mechanical systems).

(1985) developed a one-step method, TR-BDF2, for the simulation of circuits and semiconductor devices based on the trapezoidal rule and the backward differentiation formula of order 2 that provides some of the important advantages of BDF2 without the disadvantages of a memory. Its success and popularity in the context justify its study and further development for general-purpose codes. Here the method is shown to be strongly S-stable. It is shown to be optimal in a class of practical one-step methods. An efficient, globally C1 interpolation scheme is developed. The truncation error estimate of Bank et al. (1985) is not effective when the problem is very stiff. Coming to an understanding of this leads to a way of correcting the estimate and to a more effective implementation. These developments improve greatly the effectiveness of the method for very stiff problems.}

For scientists and engineers it is a practical, applied subject, part of the standard repertoire of modelling techniques.

The tension between these standpoints is the driving force of this book, which presents a rigorous account of the fundamentals of numerical analysis of both ordinary and partial differential equations. The exposition maintains a balance between theoretical, algorithmic and applied aspects. This second edition has been extensively updated, and includes new chapters on emerging subject areas: geometric numerical integration, spectral methods and conjugate gradients. Other topics covered include multistep and Runge-Kutta methods; finite difference and finite elements techniques for the Poisson equation; and a variety of algorithms to solve large, sparse algebraic systems.},

  abstract = {For purposes of evaluation and manipulation, mathematical functions f are commonly replaced by approximation polynomials p. Examples include floating-point implementations of elementary functions, integration, ordinary differential equations (ODE) solving. For that, a wide range of numerical methods exists. We consider the application of such methods in the context of rigorous computing, where we need guarantees on the accuracy of the result, with respect to both the truncation and rounding errors.A rigorous polynomial approximation (RPA) for a function f defined over an interval [a,b] is a couple (P, Delta) where P is a polynomial and Delta is an interval such that f(x)-P(x) belongs to Delta, for all x in [a,b]. In this work we analyse and bring forth several ways of obtaining RPAs for univariate functions. Firstly, we analyse and refine an existing approach based on Taylor expansions. Secondly, we replace them with better approximations such as minimax approximations, Chebyshev truncated series or interpolation polynomials.Several applications are presented: one from standard functions implementation in mathematical libraries (libm), another regarding the computation of Chebyshev series expansions solutions of linear ODEs with polynomial coefficients, and finally an automatic process for function evaluation with guaranteed accuracy in reconfigurable hardware.},
