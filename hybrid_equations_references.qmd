The theoretical and computational framework of hybrid equations has been mostly developed by a relatively small circle of researchers (Sanfelice, Goebel, Teel, ...). The primary monograph is @sanfeliceHybridFeedbackControl2021. It is also supported by a freely available Matlab toolbox, see the section on software.

The book @goebelHybridDynamicalSystems2012 can be regarded as a predecessor and/or complement of the just mentioned @sanfeliceHybridFeedbackControl2021. Although the book is not available online, a short version appears as an article @goebelHybridDynamicalSystems2009 in the popular [IEEE Control Systems magazine](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=37) (the one with color figures :-).
