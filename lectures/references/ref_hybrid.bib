  abstract = {In this paper an inverse optimal control problem in the form of a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) is considered and numerical experiences are discussed. The inverse optimal control problem arises in the context of human navigation where the body is modelled as a dynamical system and it is assumed that the motions are optimally controlled with respect to an unknown cost function. The goal of the inversion is now to find a cost function within a given parametrized family of candidate cost functions such that the corresponding optimal motion minimizes the deviation from given data. MPCCs are known to be a challenging class of optimization problems typically violating all standard constraint qualifications (CQs). We show that under certain assumptions the resulting MPCC fulfills CQs for MPCCs being the basis for theory on MPCC optimality conditions and consequently for numerical solution techniques. Finally, numerical results are presented for the discretized inverse optimal control problem of locomotion using different solution techniques based on relaxation and lifting.}

For hierarchical description of the system architecture, Charon supports building complex agents via the operations of instantiation, hiding, and parallel composition. For hierarchical description of the behavior of atomic components, Charon supports building complex modes via the operations of instantiation, scoping, and encapsulation. Features such as weak preemption, history retention, and externally defined Java functions, facilitate the description of complex discrete behavior. Continuous behavior can be specified using differential as well as algebraic constraints, and invariants restricting the flow spaces, all of which can be declared at various levels of the hierarchy. The modular structure of the language is not merely syntactic, but can be exploited during analysis. We illustrate this aspect by presenting a scheme for modular simulation in which each mode can be compiled solely based on the locally declared information to execute its discrete and continuous updates, and furthermore, submodes can integrate at a finer time scale than the enclosing modes.},

The first stage simultaneously classifies the data points and estimates the number of submodels and the corresponding parameters by solving the partition into a minimum number of feasible subsystems (MIN PFS) problem for a suitable set of linear complementary inequalities derived from data. Second, a refinement procedure reduces misclassifications and improves parameter estimates. The third stage determines a polyhedral partition of the regressor set via two-class or multiclass linear separation techniques. As a main feature, the algorithm imposes that the identification error is bounded by a quantity /spl delta/. Such a bound is a useful tuning parameter to trade off between quality of fit and model complexity. The performance of the proposed PWA system identification procedure is demonstrated via numerical examples and on experimental data from an electronic component placement process in a pick-and-place machine.}

A predictive control scheme is proposed which is able to stabilize MLD systems on desired reference trajectories while fulfilling operating constraints, and possibly take into account previous qualitative knowledge in the form of heuristic rules. Due to the presence of integer variables, the resulting on-line optimization procedures are solved through mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP), for which efficient solvers have been recently developed. Some examples and a simulation case study on a complex gas supply system are reported.},

This problem involves the estimation from data of both the parameters of the affine submodels and the partition of the PWA map. The procedure that we propose for PWA identification exploits a greedy strategy for partitioning an infeasible system of linear inequalities into a minimum number of feasible subsystems: this provides an initial clustering of the datapoints. Then a refinement procedure is applied repeatedly to the estimated clusters in order to improve both the data classification and the parameter estimation. The partition of the PWA map is finally estimated by considering pairwise the clusters of regression vectors, and by finding a separating hyperplane for each of such pairs. We show that our procedure does not require to fix a priori the number of affine submodels, which is instead automatically estimated from the data.},

We prove that PARC is a block-coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a suitably constructed objective function and that it converges in a finite number of steps. The algorithm is used to learn hybrid numerical/categorical dynamical models from data that contain real and discrete labeled values. The resulting model has a piecewise linear structure that is particularly useful to formulate model predictive control problems and solve them by mixed-integer programming.}

With a simple, unified approach, and with attention to real-time implementation, it covers predictive control theory including the stability, feasibility, and robustness of MPC controllers. The theory of explicit MPC, where the nonlinear optimal feedback controller can be calculated efficiently, is presented in the context of linear systems with linear constraints, switched linear systems, and, more generally, linear hybrid systems. Drawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples and illustrative applications, the authors discuss the techniques required to design predictive control laws, including algorithms for polyhedral manipulations, mathematical and multiparametric programming and how to validate the theoretical properties and to implement predictive control policies. The most important algorithms feature in an accompanying free online MATLAB toolbox, which allows easy access to sample solutions. Predictive Control for Linear and Hybrid Systems is an ideal reference for graduate, postgraduate and advanced control practitioners interested in theory and/or implementation aspects of predictive control.},

  abstract = {Hybrid systems arise when the continuous and the discrete meet. Combine continuous and discrete inputs, outputs, states, or dynamics, and you have a hybrid system. Particularly, hybrid systems arise from the use of finite-state logic to govern continuous physical processes (as in embedded control systems) or from topological and network constraints interacting with continuous control (as in networked control systems). This chapter provides an introduction to hybrid systems, building them up first from the completely continuous side and then from the completely discrete side. It should be accessible to control theorists and computer scientists alike.},

It covers Lagrangian and Newton--Euler systems, detailing mathematical tools such as convex analysis and complementarity theory. The ways in which nonsmooth mechanics influence and are influenced by well-posedness analysis, numerical analysis and simulation, modelling and control are explained. Contact/impact laws, stability theory and trajectory-tracking control are given detailed exposition connected by a mathematical framework formed from complementarity systems and measure-differential inclusions. Links are established with electrical circuits with set-valued nonsmooth elements as well as with other nonsmooth dynamical systems like impulsive and piecewise linear systems.Nonsmooth Mechanics (third edition) retains the topical structure familiar from its predecessors but has been substantially rewritten, edited and updated to account for the significant body of results that have emerged in the twenty-first century\texthorizontalbar including developments in:the existence and uniqueness of solutions;impact models;extension of the~Lagrange--Dirichlet theorem and trajectory tracking; andwell-posedness of contact complementarity problems with and without friction.Many figures (both new and redrawn to improve the clarity of the presentation) and examples are used to illustrate the theoretical developments. Material introducing the mathematics of nonsmooth mechanics has been improved to reflect the broad range of applications interest that has developed since publication of the second edition. The detail of some mathematical essentials is provided in four appendices.With its improved bibliography of over 1,300 references and wide-ranging coverage, Nonsmooth Mechanics~(third edition) is sure to be an invaluable resource for researchers and postgraduates studying the control of mechanical systems, robotics, granular matter and relevant fields of applied mathematics.``The book's two best features, in my view are its detailed survey of the literature\dots{} and its detailed presentation of many examples illustrating both the techniques and their limitations\dots{} For readers interested in the field, this book will serve as an excellent introductory survey.''

  abstract = {Legged robots that operate in the real world are inherently subject to stochasticity in their dynamics and uncertainty about the terrain. Owing to limited energy budgets and limited control authority, these ``disturbances'' cannot always be canceled out with high-gain feedback. Minimally actuated walking machines subject to stochastic disturbances no longer satisfy strict conditions for limit-cycle stability; however, they can still demonstrate impressively long-living periods of continuous walking. Here, we employ tools from stochastic processes to examine the ``stochastic stability'' of idealized rimless-wheel and compass-gait walking on randomly generated uneven terrain. Furthermore, we employ tools from numerical stochastic optimal control to design a controller for an actuated compass gait model which maximizes a measure of stochastic stability---the mean first-passage time---and compare its performance with a deterministic counterpart. Our results demonstrate that walking is well characterized as a metastable process, and that the stochastic dynamics of walking should be accounted for during control design in order to improve the stability of our machines.},

The well-posedness issue, in the sense of existence and uniqueness of solutions, is of considerable importance from a model validation point of view.

In terms of electrical circuits, the systems that we study may be viewed as passive networks with ideal diodes. Extending results from earlier work, we consider here complementarity systems with external inputs. It is shown that the assumption of passivity of the underlying input/output dynamical system plays an important role in establishing existence and uniqueness of solutions. We prove that solutions may contain delta functions but no higher-order impulses. Several characterizations are provided for the state jumps that may occur due to inconsistent initialization or to input discontinuities. Many of the results still hold when the assumption of passivity is replaced by the assumption of ``passifiability by pole shifting''. The paper ends with some remarks on stability.},

Cohesively edited by leading experts in the field, the book introduces the theoretical basics, computational methods, and applications of SHS. It first discusses the underlying principles behind SHS and the main design limitations of SHS. Building on these fundamentals, the authoritative contributors present methods for computer calculations that apply SHS analysis and synthesis techniques in practice. The book concludes with examples of systems encountered in a wide range of application areas, including molecular biology, communication networks, and air traffic management. It also explains how to resolve practical problems associated with these systems. Stochastic Hybrid Systems achieves an ideal balance between a theoretical treatment of SHS and practical considerations. The book skillfully explores the interaction of physical processes with computerized equipment in an uncertain environment, enabling a better understanding of sophisticated as well as everyday devices and processes.},

Contact-implicit model-predictive control (CI-MPC) generalizes linear MPC to contact-rich settings by relying on linear complementarity problems (LCP) computed using strategic Taylor approximations about a reference trajectory and retaining non-smooth impact and friction dynamics, allowing the policy to not only reason about contact forces and timing, but also generate entirely new contact mode sequences online. To achieve reliable and fast numerical convergence, we devise a structure-exploiting, path-following solver for the LCP contact dynamics and a custom trajectory optimizer for trajectory-tracking MPC problems. We demonstrate CI-MPC at real-time rates in simulation, and show that it is robust to model mismatch and can respond to disturbances by discovering and exploiting new contact modes across a variety of robotic systems, including a pushbot, hopper, and planar quadruped and biped.},

Components exhibit hybrid behavior, consisting of continuous-time phases separated by discrete-event transitions. Components may evolve independently, or they may interact through selected state variables and events. The interaction network itself may evolve.SHIFT is currently used in two applications: automated highway Systems and coordinated submarine Systems. The SHIFT model offers the proper level of abstraction for describing these and other applications such as air traffic control Systems and robotic shop-floors whose dynamic reconfigurations cannot be captured easily by conventional models. We have implemented a Compiler and a run-time system for SHIFT. The Compiler translates a SHIFT program into a C program, which, when run, simulates the design specified in the SHIFT source program.More Information about SHIFT can be found at www.path.berkeley.edu/ shift.},

This section gives an overview of the modeling formalisms that have been elaborated in hybrid systems theory in the past.Structure of hybrid systems Many different models have been proposed in literature, as will be seen in following chapters. These models can be distinguished with respect to the phenomena that they are able to represent in an explicit form. Consequently, these models have different fields of applications. The main idea of these models is described by the block diagram shown in Fig. 2.1, which is often used in literature as a starting point of hybrid systems modeling and analysis, although not all models use this structure in a direct way.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the study of complex motor control systems, we consider the identification and control of PieceWise Affine (PWA) systems and propose a novel data-driven framework that adaptively inverts the dynamics of such systems using noisy sampled data. First, we propose a novel PWA identification algorithm based on convex optimization applicable to both state--space and input/output models. Given a PWA model of the dynamics obtained from the identification algorithm, we consider the control of the resulting hybrid system where our goal is to find an input that reproduces a given reference trajectory or that extremizes a performance criterion. We demonstrate our proposed framework on a model of a jumping robot.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control problems for constrained hybrid systems are usually cast as mixed-integer optimization problems (MIP). However, commercial MIP solvers are designed to run on desktop computing platforms and are not suited for embedded applications which are typically restricted by limited computational power and memory. To alleviate these restrictions, we develop a novel low-complexity, iterative method for a class of non-convex, non-smooth optimization problems. This class of problems encompasses hybrid model predictive control problems where the dynamics are piece-wise affine (PWA). We give conditions such that the proposed algorithm has fixed points and show that, under practical assumptions, our method is guaranteed to converge locally to local minima. This is in contrast to other low-complexity methods in the literature, such as the non-convex alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM), for which no such guarantees are known for this class of problems. By interpreting the PWA dynamics as a union of polyhedra we can exploit the problem structure and develop an algorithm based on operator splitting procedures. Our algorithm departs from the traditional MIP formulation, and leads to a simple, embeddable method that only requires matrix-vector multiplications and small-scale projections onto polyhedra. We illustrate the efficacy of the method on two numerical examples, achieving good closed-loop performance with computational times several orders of magnitude smaller compared to state-of-the-art MIP solvers. Moreover, it is competitive with ADMM in terms of suboptimality and computation time, but additionally provides local optimality and local convergence guarantees.},

The study of mechanical legged motion has been motivated by its potential use as a means of locomotion in rough terrain, as well as its potential benefits to prothesis development and testing. The paper concentrates on issues related to the automatic control of biped robots. More precisely, its primary goal is to contribute a means to prove asymptotically-stable walking in planar, underactuated biped robot models. Since normal walking can be viewed as a periodic solution of the robot model, the method of Poincare sections is the natural means to study asymptotic stability of a walking cycle. However, due to the complexity of the associated dynamic models, this approach has had limited success. The principal contribution of the present work is to show that the control strategy can be designed in a way that greatly simplifies the application of the method of Poincare to a class of biped models, and, in fact, to reduce the stability assessment problem to the calculation of a continuous map from a subinterval of R to itself. The mapping in question is directly computable from a simulation model. The stability analysis is based on a careful formulation of the robot model as a system with impulse effects and the extension of the method of Poincare sections to this class of models.}

These mathematical models come in all kinds of variations, but basically consist of some form of differential or difference equations on the one hand and automata or other discrete-event models on the other hand.

The framework we describe is suitable for certain situations in which both differential equations and inequalities play a role; for instance, in mechanics, electrical networks, piecewise linear systems, and dynamic optimization. We present a precise definition of the solution concept of linear complementarity systems and give sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions.}

  abstract = {Modeling of hybrid systems using mixed logical dynamical (MLD) systems is an art. The MLD framework often introduces numerous constraints and auxiliary binary and continuous variables, which, in turn, increase the computational complexity of the optimization problems. This paper presents an automaton-based realization for discrete-time hybrid automaton (DHA) with both controlled and uncontrolled switching phenomena by which it is attempted to develop efficient translation techniques to MLD systems and reduce the total number of decision variables in the MLD model. Based on this DHA model, a modified version of MLD systems, which is called extended MLD (EMLD) is formally defined and represented. EMLD is derived based on the concept of forward evolution in which the one-step delay between the change of discrete states and continuous dynamics of the existing evolution in the conventional MLD systems is eliminated. The result is that the size of EMLD model in terms of the number of variables, which determines the complexity of the synthesis problems on MLD systems, is reduced. The dynamical properties such as the nonblocking, determinism, and well-posedness of the proposed DHA and its equivalent MLD models are investigated, and the necessary and sufficient conditions are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed ideas is shown by the numerical examples.},

Many verification tasks for such programs can be expressed as reachability problems for hybrid automata. By improving on previous decidability and undecidability results, we identify a boundary between decidability and undecidability for the reachability problem of hybrid automata. On the positive side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE reachability algorithm for the case of initialized rectangular automata, where all analog variables follow independent trajectories within piecewise-linear envelopes and are reinitialized whenever the envelope changes. Our algorithm is based on the construction of a timed automaton that contains all reachability information about a given initialized rectangular automaton. The translation has practical significance for verification, because it guarantees the termination of symbolic procedures for the reachability analysis of initialized rectangular automata. The translation also preserves the{$\omega$}-languages of initialized rectangular automata with bounded nondeterminism. On the negative side, we show that several slight generalizations of initialized rectangular automata lead to an undecidable reachability problem. In particular, we prove that the reachability problem is undecidable for timed automata augmented with a single stopwatch.},

  abstract = {Hybrid or continuous/discrete systems have attracted increased scientific attention in recent years. In fact, most technical systems consist of physical (sub)systems which are governed by continuous dynamics, continuous or discrete-time controllers, and logical systems which react to and trigger events in the continuous parts. Hybrid systems also arise from modeling of physical phenomena alone, e.g. in evaporation and other processes with phase transitions or in mechanical systems. Beginning with Tavernini's work (1987), several rather theoretical modeling paradigms for such systems have been introduced. The dynamics of a hybrid system can simply be described as follows: Starting from an initial point the systems trajectory evolves in state space. Due to the discrete actions (phase transitions, control inputs, etc.) there exist switching manifolds in the state space. If the trajectory reaches one of these switching manifolds, the continuous dynamics of the system changes. After such a mode-change, a reinitialization of the continuous variables may be necessary, e.g. when conservation laws have to be considered. Thus the trajectory of a general hybrid dynamical system shows blips and/or jumps. In this contribution, we propose an approach to identify a model of a hybrid dynamical system from measured data.}

Since the mathematic function for the artificial potential field is discontinuous, the dynamics of such two aerial agents might be also discontinuous. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the dynamics of such two aerial agents switching on the discontinuous boundaries are firstly studied based on the complexity theory of flow switchability; 2) the ``chatter'' phenomenon due to the artificial potential field is explained as the onset of sliding motion on such a moving discontinuous boundary. In this paper, by using flow switching theory of discontinuous dynamical systems, the discontinuous dynamic behavior of a 2-DOF (two-degree-of-freedom) friction oscillator with elastic impact and rigid impact on different sides is investigated. For the 2-DOF friction oscillator, when the direction of object's velocity changes, the negative feedback works and the inequality of maximum static friction force and kinetic friction force leads to the existence of flow barriers. In addition, the elastic impact and rigid impact can change motion states of object, resulting in the discontinuity of this 2-DOF system. Considering the multiple motion states of object and better analyzing the equation of object's motion, the phase space of each object is divided into different motion domains and boundaries in relative and absolute coordinates by means of the discontinuities resulted from the friction and impact. Moreover, because the elastic impact exists in a time period, there will be a variety of motion behaviors coexisting, such as elastic and rigid impacts occur simultaneously. With that in mind, in absolute coordinate system, the phase space of the system is divided in six cases according to whether there are stick motion and stuck motion. Based on flow switching theory, the switching conditions at discontinuous boundaries for all possible motions are given by using G-functions, and it should be noted that the vanishing conditions of the sliding motion become more complicated due to the existence of flow barriers at speed boundaries. Through defining the switching sets on separation boundaries, the mapping structures are further introduced to demonstrate the global dynamic behavior and periodic motions. For a better understanding of the object's motion and the switching criteria at separation boundaries, the numerical simulation method is used to demonstrate several typical motions such as passable motion, sliding motion, grazing motion, stick motion (elastic impact), rigid impact and periodic motions etc. The results obtained have reference value for the optimization design and noise control of mechanical systems with gap couplings and negative feedbacks. We present new results on existence and uniqueness of absolutely continuous solutions for systems of discontinuous ordinary differential equations. Our existence result complements an earlier theorem by Bressan and Shen. Basically, we show that a global transversality condition assumed by Bressan and Shen need only be imposed on the sets where the nonlinear part is discontinuous. Our proof, completely different to the one given by Bressan and Shen, uses Krasovskij solutions as a first step. We illustrate the applicability of our result with several examples not covered by the previous literature. The second part of this paper concerns uniqueness. Specifically, we prove uniqueness of solutions for discontinuous systems of differential equations with piecewise Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities and assuming localized Bressan--Shen transversality conditions on the boundaries between different Lipschitz continuity domains. Our uniqueness result appears to be new even in the classical case of continuous nonlinearities. We give two conditions that are necessary and sufficient for the uniqueness of Filippov solutions to scalar, autonomous ordinary differential equations with discontinuous velocity fields. When only one of the two conditions is satisfied, we give a natural selection criterion that guarantees uniqueness of the solution. Nous donnons deux conditions n\'ecessaires et suffisantes pour l'unicit\'e des solutions de Filippov des \'equations diff\'erentielles ordinaires autonomes scalaires, avec champs de vitesse discontinus. Lorsqu'une seule de ces deux conditions est satisfaite, nous donnons un crit\`ere naturel s\'electionnant une unique solution. Passivity of memristor-based recurrent neural networks (MRNNs) with multi-proportional delays is investigated in this paper. Here, proportional delay is an unbounded time-varying delay, which is distinct from constant delay, bounded time-varying delay and distributed delay. In the sense of Filippov solution, we present several new sufficient conditions for the passivity of MRNNs with multi-proportional delays, which are delay-independent and delay-dependent, by establishing appropriate Lyapunov functionals and utilizing inequality techniques. The passivity criteria here are presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example and its simulations are given to illustrate the accuracy and validation of the obtained results.},

The notion of embedded Markov chains is proposed for such systems and some illustrative example from high way model is presented. As an important application, these ideas are then applied to the state space discretization of one dimensional SDE to obtain the natural discretized stochastic hybrid system together with its embedded MC. The invariant distribution and exit probability from interval of the MC are studied and it is shown that they converge to their counterparts for the solution process of the original SDE as the discretization step goes to zero. As a result, the discretized stochastic hybrid system provides a useful tool for studying various sample path properties of the SDE.},

We utilize a moving finite element based strategy to discretize the differential equation system to accurately locate the unknown switching points at the finite element boundary and achieve high-order accuracy at intermediate non-collocation points. We propose a globalization approach to solve the discretized MPCC problem using a mixed NLP/MILP-based strategy to converge to a non-spurious first-order optimal solution.

Previous work showed that a global solution could be obtained for continuous PWA maps with a worst-case complexity exponential in the number of data. In this paper, we show how global optimality can be reached for a slightly more general class of possibly discontinuous PWA maps with a complexity only polynomial in the number of data, however with an exponential complexity with respect to the data dimension. This result is obtained via an analysis of the intrinsic classification subproblem of associating the data points to the different modes. In addition, we prove that the problem is NP-hard, and thus that the exponential complexity in the dimension is a natural expectation for any exact algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a general hybrid systems framework to model the flow of traffic in communication networks. The proposed models use averaging to continuously approximate discrete variables such as congestion window and queue size. Because averaging occurs over short time intervals, discrete events such as the occurrences of a drop and the consequent reaction by congestion control can still be captured. This modeling framework, thus, fills a gap between purely packet-level and fluid-based models, faithfully capturing the dynamics of transient phenomena and yet providing significant flexibility in modeling various congestion control mechanisms, different queueing policies, multicast transmission, etc. The modeling framework is validated by comparing simulations of the hybrid models against packet-level simulations. It is shown that the probability density functions produced by the ns-2 network simulator match closely those obtained with hybrid models. Moreover, a complexity analysis supports the observation that in networks with large per-flow bandwidths, simulations using hybrid models require significantly less computational resources than ns-2 simulations. Tools developed to automate the generation and simulation of hybrid systems models are also presented. Their use is showcased in a study, which simulates TCP flows with different roundtrip times over the Abilene backbone.}

This systems paradigm is particularly useful in modeling applications where high-level decision making is used to supervise process behavior. Hybrid system methodologies are also applicable to switched systems where the system switches between various setpoints or operational modes to extend its effective operating range. Hybrid systems, therefore, embrace a diverse set of applications. There has been considerable activity in the area of hybrid systems theory, and this article provides an introduction to some of the basic concepts and trends in this emergent field. The term hybrid refers to a mixing of two fundamentally different types of objects or methods. The paper deals with supervisory hybrid systems. Supervisory hybrid systems are systems that combine discrete event and continuous-valued dynamics. The article is organized as follows. We first provide an example of a hybrid system, to be used throughout as a pedagogical tool illustrating various concepts in hybrid systems theory. We then discuss modeling frameworks for hybrid systems, paying specific attention to the hybrid automaton. Not only may the system have a hybrid character, but the specifications on desired system behaviors may also be hybrid. The article also discusses specification logics that express system requirements on both the discrete and continuous states of the system. The article continues with a survey of current methods and concepts used to verify or validate desired system behaviors, and concludes with a survey of current methods for hybrid control system synthesis.}

Based on a number of observations on typical mixed discrete and continuous features for such applications, a fairly general model structure for hybrid systems is proposed. This model structure, which clearly separates the open-loop plant from the closed-loop system, is suitable for analysis and synthesis of hybrid control systems. To illustrate this, three different approaches for control-law synthesis based on continuous and discrete specifications are discussed. In the first one, the hybrid plant model is replaced by a purely discrete event model, related to the continuous specification, and a supervisor is synthesized applying supervisory control theory suggested by Ramadge and Wonham (1987). The other two methods directly utilize the continuous specification for determination of a control event generator, where time-optimal aspects are introduced as an option in the last approach.}

We motivate our approach by showing how the proposed synthesis technique simplifies to well-known results from supervisory control and pursuit evasion games when restricted to purely discrete and purely continuous systems respectively. We then illustrate the application of this technique to two examples, one hybrid (the steam boiler benchmark problem), and one primarily continuous (a flight vehicle management system with discrete flight modes).}

This paper describes multi-modal symbolic regression (MMSR): a learning algorithm to construct non-linear symbolic representations of discrete dynamical systems with continuous mappings from unlabeled, time-series data. MMSR consists of two subalgorithms---clustered symbolic regression, a method to simultaneously identify distinct behaviors while formulating their mathematical expressions, and transition modeling, an algorithm to infer symbolic inequalities that describe binary classification boundaries. These subalgorithms are combined to infer hybrid dynamical systems as a collection of apt, mathematical expressions. MMSR is evaluated on a collection of four synthetic data sets and outperforms other multi-modal machine learning approaches in both accuracy and interpretability, even in the presence of noise. Furthermore, the versatility of MMSR is demonstrated by identifying and inferring classical expressions of transistor modes from recorded measurements.},

  abstract = {Hybrid systems are systems that exhibit a combination of discrete and continuous behavior. Typical hybrid systems include computer components, which operate in discrete program steps, and real-world components, whose behavior over time intervals evolves according to physical constraints. Important examples of hybrid systems include automated transportation systems, robotics systems, process control systems, systems of embedded devices, and mobile computing systems. Such systems can be very complex, and very difficult to describe and analyze. This paper presents the Hybrid Input/Output Automaton (HIOA) modeling framework, a basic mathematical framework to support description and analysis of hybrid systems. An important feature of this model is its support for decomposing hybrid system descriptions. In particular, the framework includes a notion of external behavior for a hybrid I/O automaton, which captures its discrete and continuous interactions with its environment. The framework also defines what it means for one HIOA to implement another, based on an inclusion relationship between their external behavior sets, and defines a notion of simulation, which provides a sufficient condition for demonstrating implementation relationships. The framework also includes a composition operation for HIOAs, which respects the implementation relation and a notion of receptiveness, which implies that an HIOA does not block the passage of time. The framework is intended to support analysis methods from both computer science and control theory. This work is a simplification of our earlier HIOA model. The main simplification in the new model is a clearer separation between the mechanisms used to model discrete and continuous interaction between components. In particular, the new model removes the dual use of external variables for discrete and continuous interactions.},

  abstract = {Different aspects of hybrid control systems are treated: analysis, simulation, design and implementation. A systematic methodology using extended Lyapunov theory for design of hybrid systems is developed. The methodology is based on conventional control designs in separate regions together with a switching strategy. Dynamics are not well defined if the control design methods lead to fast mode switching. The dynamics depend on the salient features of the implementation of the mode switches. A theorem for the stability of second order switching together with the resulting dynamics is derived. The dynamics on an intersection of two sliding sets are defined for two relays working on different time scales. The current simulation packages have problems modeling and simulating hybrid systems. It is shown how fast mode switches can be found before or during simulation. The necessary analysis work is a very small overhead for a modern simulation tool. To get some experience from practical problems with hybrid control the switching strategy is implemented in two different software environments. In one of them a time-optimal controller is added to an existing PID controller on a commercial control system. Successful experiments with this hybrid controller shows the practical use of the method.},

Moreover, recently developed model identification methodologies largely focus on identifying a single set of governing equations solely from measurement data. In this article, we develop a new methodology, Hybrid-Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics, which identifies separate nonlinear dynamical regimes, employs information theory to manage uncertainty and characterizes switching behaviour. Specifically, we use the nonlinear geometry of data collected from a complex system to construct a set of coordinates based on measurement data and augmented variables. Clustering the data in these measurement-based coordinates enables the identification of nonlinear hybrid systems. This methodology broadly empowers nonlinear system identification without constraining the data locally in time and has direct connections to hybrid systems theory. We demonstrate the success of this method on numerical examples including a mass--spring hopping model and an infectious disease model. Characterizing complex systems that switch between dynamic behaviours is integral to overcoming modern challenges such as eradication of infectious diseases, the design of efficient legged robots and the protection of cyber infrastructures.}

  abstract = {In hybrid model predictive control (MPC), a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) is solved at each sampling time to compute the optimal control action. Although these optimizations are generally very demanding, in MPC, we expect consecutive problem instances to be nearly identical. This article addresses the question of how computations performed at one time step can be reused to accelerate (warm start) the solution of subsequent MIQPs. Reoptimization is not a rare practice in integer programming: for small variations of certain problem data, the branch-and-bound algorithm allows an efficient reuse of its search tree and the dual bounds of its leaf nodes. In this article, we extend these ideas to the receding-horizon settings of MPC. The warm-start algorithm we propose copes naturally with arbitrary model errors, has a negligible computational cost, and frequently enables an a priori pruning of most of the search space. Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence show that the proposed method tends to reduce the combinatorial complexity of the hybrid MPC problem to that of a one-step look-ahead optimization, greatly easing the online computation burden.}

  abstract = {Hybrid systems are a useful abstraction for systems that have a combination of discrete and continuous dynamics. For typical examples of hybrid systems, there can be various sources of stochasticity. The source of stochasticity can be in the dynamics of the continuous states, the probabilistic switching between various modes of the system and the probabilistic resetting of the continuous state after switches. Such systems can be mathematically modeled by Discrete Time Stochastic Hybrid Systems (DTSHS). If the uncertainty in the initial condition of the stochastic hybrid system is specified by a probability distribution, it is useful to compute the probability distribution of the state of the system for some time in the future. This would allow one to quantify the probability of the system to be in an undesired or unsafe set. Such computations can be useful for probabilistic verification and validation of systems. In this paper, we discuss state space models for DTSHS and present computational methods to propagate probability distributions for DTSHS.}

To cope with the sporadic availability of measurements of the output, a hybrid dynamic output feedback controller equipped with a holding device whose state is reset when a new measurement is available is designed. The closed-loop system, resulting from the interconnection of the controller and the plant, is augmented with a timer variable triggering the arrival of new measurements and its properties are analyzed using hybrid system tools. Building upon Lyapunov theory for hybrid systems, sufficient conditions for internal and \textbackslash mathcal L\_2 input-to-output stability are proposed.

  abstract = {Combining; discrete state transitions with differential equations, Hybrid system models provide an expressive formalism for describing software systems that interact with a physical environment. Automatically checking properties, such as invariance and stability, is extremely hard for general hybrid models, and therefore current research focuses on models with restricted expressive power. In this thesis we take a complementary approach by developing proof techniques that are not necessarily automatic, but are applicable to a general class of hybrid systems. Three components of this thesis, namely, (i) semantics for ordinary and probabilistic hybrid models, (ii) methods for proving invariance, stability, and abstraction, and (iii) software tools supporting (i) and (ii), are integrated within a common mathematical framework. (i) For specifying nonprobabilistic hybrid models, we present Structured Hybrid I/O Automata (SHIOAs) which adds control theory-inspired structures, namely state models, to the existing Hybrid I/O Automata, thereby facilitating description of continuous behavior. We introduce a generalization of SHIOAs which allows both nondeterministic and stochastic transitions and develop the trace-based semantics for this framework. (ii) We present two techniques for establishing lower-bounds on average dwell time (ADT) for SHIOA models. This provides a sufficient condition of establishing stability for SHIOAs with stable state models. A new simulation-based technique which is sound for proving ADT-equivalence of SHIOAs is proposed. We develop notions of approximate implementation and corresponding proof techniques for Probabilistic I/O Automata. Specifically, a PIOA A is an E-approximate implementation of B, if every trace distribution of A is c-close to some trace distribution of B-closeness being measured by a metric on the space of trace distributions.},

The PWARX model is composed of ARX sub-models each of which corresponds to a polyhedral region of the regression space. Under the temporary assumption that the number of sub-models is known a priori, the input--output data are collected into several clusters by using a statistical clustering algorithm. We utilize support vector classifiers to estimate the boundary hyperplane between two adjacent regions in the regression space. In each cluster, the parameter vector of the sub-model is obtained by the least squares method. It turns out that the present statistical clustering approach enables us to estimate the number of sub-models based on the information criteria such as CAIC and MDL. The estimate of the number of sub-models is performed by applying the identification procedure several times to the same data set, after having fixed the number of sub-models to different values. Finally, we verify the applicability of the present identification method through a numerical example of a Hammerstein model.},

Hysteresis is a rate independent memory effect which often results in severe nonsmoothness in the dynamics. These systems are not simply Piecewise Smooth Systems (PSS); they are a more complicated form of hybrid systems. We introduce a time-freezing reformulation which transforms these systems into a PSS. From the theoretical side, this reformulation opens the door to study systems with hysteresis via the rich tools developed for Filippov systems. From the practical side, it enables the use of the recently developed Finite Elements with Switch Detection (Nurkanovi\'c et al., 2022), which makes high accuracy numerical optimal control of hybrid systems with hysteresis possible. We provide a time optimal control problem example and compare our approach to mixed-integer formulations from the literature.}

We consider the Filippov convexification of these systems and a transformation into dynamic complementarity systems introduced by [Stewart, 1990]. FESD is based on solving nonlinear complementarity problems and can automatically detect nonsmooth events in time. If standard time-stepping Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are naively applied to a nonsmooth ODE, the accuracy is at best of order one. In FESD, we let the integrator step size be a degree of freedom. Additional complementarity conditions, which we call cross complementarities, enable exact switch detection, hence FESD can recover the high order accuracy that the RK methods enjoy for smooth ODE. Additional conditions called step equilibration allow the step size to change only when switches occur and thus avoid spurious degrees of freedom. Convergence results for the FESD method are derived, local uniqueness of the solution and convergence of numerical sensitivities are proven. The efficacy of FESD is demonstrated in several simulation and optimal control examples. In an optimal control problem benchmark with FESD, we achieve up to five orders of magnitude more accurate solutions than a standard time-stepping approach for the same computational time.},

The nonsmooth discrete-time OCP are solved with techniques of continuous optimization in a homotopy procedure, without the use of integer variables. This enables the treatment of a broad class of nonsmooth systems in a unified way. Two tutorial examples are given. A benchmark shows that NOSNOC provides both faster and more accurate solutions than conventional approaches, including mixed-integer formulations.}

The MPCC theory and stationarity concepts are reviewed and summarized. The focus is on relaxation-based methods for MPCCs, which solve a (finite) sequence of more regular nonlinear programs (NLP), where a regularization/homotopy parameter is driven to zero. Such methods perform reasonably well on currently available benchmarks. However, these results do not always generalize to MPCCs obtained from nonsmooth OCPs. To provide a more complete picture, this paper introduces a novel benchmark collection of such problems, which we call nosbench. The problem set includes 603 different MPCCs and we split it into a few representative subsets to accelerate the testing. We compare different relaxation-based methods, NLP solvers, homotopy parameter update and relaxation parameter steering strategies. Moreover, we check whether the obtained stationary points allow first-order descent directions, which may be the case for some of the weaker MPCC stationarity concepts. In the best case, the Scholtes' relaxation [Scholtes, 2002] with IPOPT [W\"achter and Biegler, 2006] as NLP solver manages to solve 73.8 \% of the problems. This highlights the need for further improvements in algorithms and software for MPCCs.},

The pieces of the trajectory that correspond to the parts when the clock state was evolving recover the solution of the original system with jumps. Our reformulation results in nonsmooth ordinary differential equations where the discontinuity is in the first time derivative of the trajectory, rather than in the trajectory itself. This class of systems is easier to handle both theoretically and numerically. The reformulation is suitable for partially elastic mechanical impact problems. We provide numerical examples demonstrating the ease of use of this reformulation in both simulation and optimal control. In the optimal control example, we solve a sequence of nonlinear programming problems (NLPs) in a homotopy penalization approach and recover a time-optimal trajectory with state jumps.}

We cover the difficult case when the system evolves on the boundary of the dynamic's feasible set after the state jump. In nonsmooth mechanics, this corresponds to inelastic impacts. The main idea of the time-freezing reformulation is to introduce a clock state and an auxiliary dynamical system whose trajectory endpoints satisfy the state jump law. When the auxiliary system is active, the clock state is not evolving, hence by taking only the parts of the trajectory when the clock state was active, we can recover the original solution. The resulting time-freezing system is a Filippov system that has jump discontinuities only in the first time derivative instead of the trajectory itself. This enables one to use the recently proposed Finite Elements with Switch Detection [Nurkanovic et al., 2022], which makes high accuracy numerical optimal control of CLS with impacts and friction possible. We detail how to recover the solution of the original system and show how to select appropriate auxiliary dynamics. The theoretical findings are illustrated on a nontrivial numerical optimal control example of a hopping one-legged robot.},

The demand for novel hybrid system identification algorithms is therefore of growing interest and essential for the development of control algorithms for this type of systems.

The identification of piecewise affine systems is here tackled by overparametrizing and assigning a regressor-parameter to each of the observations. The regressor parameters are forced to be the same if that not causes a major increase in the fit term. The formulation takes the shape of a least-squares problem with sum-of-norms regularization over regressor parameter differences, a generalization of {$\ell$}1-regularization.

Indeed, In the first part, we focused on optimal control problems under complementarity constraints. We studied optimal control problems governed by semi linear elliptic variational inequalities involving constraints on the state. We presented a new regularisation schema for the complementarity constraint. We proved that Lagrange multipliers exist. Then, in the second part, we have studied linear complementarity problems (LCPs) and nonlinear complementarity problems (NCPs) by proposing new methods of regularisation to solve these kind of problems. The idea of these methods takes inspiration from interior point methods. Throughout this manuscript, we have focused on the theoretical properties of algorithms and their digital applications.},

  abstract = {Hybrid systems combine time-driven and event-driven dynamics. This is a natural framework for manufacturing processes: The physical characteristics of production parts undergo changes at various operations described by time-driven models, while the timing control of operations is described by event-driven models. Accordingly, in the framework we propose, manufactured parts are characterized by physical states (e.g. temperature, geometry) subject to time-driven dynamics and by temporal states (e.g., operation start and stop times) subject to event-driven dynamics. We first provide a tutorial introduction to this hybrid system framework and associated optimal control problems through a single-stage manufacturing process model. We then show how the structure of the problem can be exploited to decompose what is a hard nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization problem into a collection of simpler problems. Next, we present extensions to multistage manufacturing processes for which we develop solution algorithms that make use of Bezier approximation techniques. Emphasis is given to the issue of deriving solutions through efficient algorithms, and some explicit numerical results are included.}

Impulsive systems are also encountered in numerous problems of natural sciences described by mathematical models with conditions reflecting the impulsive action of external forces with pulses whose duration can be neglected. Differential equations with set-valued right-hand side arise in the investigation of evolution processes in the case of measurement errors, inaccuracy or incompleteness of information, action of bounded perturbations, violation of unique solvability conditions, etc. Differential inclusions also allow one to describe the dynamics of controlled processes and are widely used in the theory of optimal control. This monograph is devoted to the investigation of impulsive differential equations with set-valued and discontinuous right-hand sides. It is intended for researchers, lecturers, postgraduate students, and students of higher schools specialized in the field of the theory of differential equations, the theory of optimal control, and their applications.},

We consider in particular the identification of piecewise affine models of nonlinear single-input/single-output systems through the prediction error minimization approach. The objective of this work is to analyze the performance of the identified model as the number of data used in the identification procedure grows to infinity. We consider a stochastic setting where the input and output signals are strictly stationary stochastic processes. Under suitable ergodicity assumptions, we show that the identified model is asymptotically optimal. The adopted approach is based on recent developments in statistical learning theory, and appears promising for studying the finite-sample properties of the identified model.}

The construction of such a feedback hinges upon recasting a stabilizing patchy feedback in a hybrid framework by making it dynamic with a discrete state, while insisting on semicontinuity and closedness properties of the hybrid feedback and of the resulting closed-loop hybrid system. The robustness of stability is then shown as a generic property of hybrid systems having the said regularity properties. Auxiliary results give uniformity of convergence and of overshoots for hybrid systems, and give a characterization of asymptotic stability of compact sets.}

In this paper an almost sure convergence analysis for numerical simulation algorithms for Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes is presented. The discussed numerical methods arise through discretising a constructive method defining these processes. The stochastic problem of simulating the random, path-dependent jump times of such processes is reformulated as a hitting time problem for a system of ordinary differential equations with random threshold. Then deterministic continuous methods (methods with dense output) are serially employed to solve these problems numerically. We show that the almost sure convergence rate of the stochastic algorithm is identical to the order of the embedded deterministic method. We illustrate our theoretical findings by numerical examples from mathematical neuroscience, Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes are used as biophysically accurate stochastic models of neuronal membranes.}

Nearby solutions jump at close but noncoincident times, making the standard notion of closeness, based on vector difference, unsuitable to compare trajectories point-wise in time. With tracking control as ultimate goal, we propose a notion of stability and a constructive stability proof based on sensitivity analysis applicable to single-jump-flow trajectories. A key role in the analysis is played by a time-triggered linear system, associated with the discontinuous trajectory of interest, whose uniform asymptotic stability suffices to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the original discontinuous trajectory. As an illustrative example, the stability analysis is applied to guarantee closed-loop stable tracking for a trajectory with velocity jumps of a 2 DoF mechanical system with unilateral constraint.}

By explaining how available measurements can be used to deduce past and future behaviours of a system, the authors extend this study of observability to embrace the properties of diagnosability and predictability.H-systems shows how continuous and discrete dynamics and their interaction affect the observability of this general class of hybrid systems and demonstrates that hybrid characteristics are not simply generalizations of well-known aspects of traditional dynamics. The authors identify conditions for state reconstruction, prediction and diagnosis of the occurrence of possibly faulty states. The formal approach to proving those properties for hybrid systems is accompanied by simple illustrative examples. For readers who are interested in the use of state estimation for controller design, the book also provides design methods for hybrid state observers and covers their application in some industrial cases.The book's tutorial approach to the various forms of observability of hybrid systems helps to make H-systems of interest to academic researchers and graduate students working in control and to practitioners using control in an industrial environment.},

In our work, we are motivated by optimal control of mechanical systems with Coulomb friction, which exhibit such a right-hand side. Notwithstanding the impressive development of nonsmooth and set-valued analysis, these systems have not been closely studied either computationally or analytically. We show that even when the solution crosses and does not stay on the discontinuity, differentiating the results of a simulation gives gradients that have errors of a size independent of the stepsize. This means that the strategy of ``optimize the discretization'' will usually fail for problems of this kind. We approximate the discontinuous right-hand side for the differential equations or inclusions by a smooth right-hand side. For these smoothed approximations, we show that the resulting gradients approach the true gradients provided that the start and end points of the trajectory do not lie on the discontinuity and that Euler's method is used where the step size is ``sufficiently small'' in comparison with the smoothing parameter. Numerical results are presented for a crude model of car racing that involves Coulomb friction and slip showing that this approach is practical and can handle problems of moderate complexity.},

Several examples are given to illustrate the utility of this simple modeling class and Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for various stability properties are given. The second half of the tutorial addresses a recent, more general stochastic hybrid systems modeling framework that permits state conditions to trigger jumps and that allows for non-unique solutions, via stochastic differential and difference inclusions and possibly overlapping flow and jump sets. Examples are provided to show the relevance of models that admit non-unique solutions and forced jumps.

  abstract = {This paper presents a computational framework for modeling hybrid systems in discrete-time. We introduce the class of discrete hybrid automata (DHA) and show its relation with several other existing model paradigms: piecewise affine systems, mixed logical dynamical systems, (extended) linear complementarity systems, min-max-plus-scaling systems. We present HYSDEL (hybrid systems description language), a high-level modeling language for DHA, and a set of tools for translating DHA into any of the former hybrid models. Such a multimodeling capability of HYSDEL is particularly appealing for exploiting a large number of available analysis and synthesis techniques, each one developed for a particular class of hybrid models. An automotive example shows the modeling capabilities of HYSDEL and how the different models allow to use several computational tools.}

The use of such a framework is well known for mechanical systems with inequality constraints, but we give a more general formulation which also applies, for instance, to switching control systems. The main theoretical results in the paper are concerned with uniqueness of smooth continuations; the solution of this problem requires the construction of a map from the continuous state to the discrete state. A crucial technical tool is the so-called linear complementarity problem from mathematical programming, and we introduce various generalizations of this problem.}

  abstract = {This book is about dynamical systems that are "hybrid" in the sense that they contain both continuous and discrete state variables. Recently there has been increased research interest in the study of the interaction between discrete and continuous dynamics. The present volume provides a first attempt in book form to bring together concepts and methods dealing with hybrid systems from various areas, and to look at these from a unified perspective.The authors have chosen a mode of exposition that is largely based on illustrative examples rather than on the abstract theorem-proof format because the systematic study of hybrid systems is still in its infancy. The examples are taken from many different application areas, ranging from power converters to communication protocols and from chaos to mathematical finance.Subjects covered include the following: definition of hybrid systems; description formats; existence and uniqueness of solutions; special subclasses (variable-structure systems, complementarity systems); reachability and verification; stability and stabilizability; control design methods. The book will be of interest to scientists from a wide range of disciplines including: computer science, control theory, dynamical system theory, systems modeling and simulation, and operations research.},

  abstract = {The use of stochastic models, in effect piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), has become increasingly popular especially for the modeling of chemical reactions and cell biophysics. Yet, exact simulation methods, for the simulation of these models in evolving environments, are limited by the need to find the next jumping time at each recursion of the algorithm. Here, we report on a new general method to find this jumping time for the True Jump Method. It is based on an expression in terms of ordinary differential equations for which efficient numerical methods are available. As such, our new result makes it possible to study numerically stochastic models for which analytical formulas are not available thereby providing a way to approximate the state distribution for example. We conclude that the wide use of event detection schemes for the simulation of PDMPs should be strongly reconsidered. The only relevant remaining question being the efficiency of our method compared to the Fictitious Jump Method, question which is strongly case dependent.},

  abstract = {This thesis focuses on the optimal control of Linear Complementarity Systems (LCS). LCS are dynamical systems defined through Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE), where one of the variable is defined by a Linear Complementarity Problem.These systems can be found in the modeling of various phenomena, as Nash equilibria, hybrid dynamical systems or modeling of electrical circuits. Properties of the solution to these DAE essentially depend on properties that the matrix D in the complementarity must meet. These complementarity constraints induce two different challenges. First, the analysis of these dynamical systems often use state of the art tools, and their study still has some unansweredquestions. Second, the optimal control of these systems causes troubles due to on one hand the presence of the state in the constraints, on the other hand the violation of Constraint Qualifications, that are a recurring hypothesis for optimisation problems.The research presented in this manuscript focuses on the optimal control of these systems. We mainly focus on the quadratic optimal control problem (minimisation of a quadratic functional involving the state and the control), and the minimal time control. The results present two different aspects: first, we start with an analytical approach in order to find necessary conditions of optimality (if possible, these conditions are proved to be sufficient); secondly, a numerical approach is tackled, with the aim of getting precise results with a reduced computational time.},

Next, we introduce the notion of an invariant set for hybrid dynamical systems and we define several types of (Lyapunov-like) stability concepts for an invariant set. We then establish sufficient conditions for uniform stability, uniform asymptotic stability, exponential stability, and instability of an invariant set of hybrid dynamical systems. Under some mild additional assumptions, we also establish necessary conditions for some of the above stability types (converse theorems). In addition to the above, we also establish sufficient conditions for the uniform boundedness of the motions of hybrid dynamical systems (Lagrange stability). To demonstrate the applicability of the developed theory, we present specific examples of hybrid dynamical systems and we conduct a stability analysis of some of these examples.}

  abstract = {Dissipativity theory is an important energy-based framework for the analysis and design of control systems using an input--output approach. Quadratic supply rate functions in particular have been of great interest since their introduction by Jan Willems. Quadratic supply rate dissipativity exhibits many interesting properties, including a tighter relation to stability. Q-dissipativity and its most prominent special case, passivity, are classical tools. However, their relevance to cyberphysical system (CPS) design stems from the fact that these concepts can be extended to more general hybrid/ switched and networked systems. Dissipative and passive systems exhibit a compositional property for parallel and negative feedback interconnections. Thus, by ensuring that each subsystem is passive, a complex system can be constructed to satisfy specific properties by design and avoid undesirable emergent behaviors. Passivity indices also stem from Q-dissipativity. They are measures of passivity margins and further extend the applicability of passivity-based tools to nonpassive systems as well. The indices have been used in designing secure and stable interconnected systems, hybrid systems, and data-driven analysis and control design. Because of these facts, measures of passivity have been further developed for systems with significant cybercomponents. This short article provides a brief overview of of these new findings in the context of CPSs and presents directions for future work.}
