## Knowledge (remember and understand)
 
- Restricting to a hybrid automaton with linear dynamics in each mode, formulate the problem of finding a CQLF as a linear matrix inequality.
- Explain the S-procedure and show how it can be used to formulate the problem of a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function?

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Analyze stability of a switched linear system using a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function.
