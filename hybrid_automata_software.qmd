## Matlab

- pure Simulink: [Relational operators](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/relationaloperator.html), [Logical operators](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/logicaloperator.html), Extra options for the [Integrator](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/integrator.html) block (external reset, external initial conditions, possibly state port).
- pure Matlab: [Event Location](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/ode-event-location.html) with ODE solvers.
- Stateflow: [Continuous-time modeling in Stateflow](https://www.mathworks.com/help/stateflow/ug/about-continuous-time-modeling.html)

## Julia

- [HybridSystems.jl](https://github.com/blegat/HybridSystems.jl) â€“ the package essentially just defines some basic data types, currently it is mainly used by some other packages, such as ReachabilityAnalysis.jl.
