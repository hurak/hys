There is a well-developed and actively maintained Matlab toolbox

- Sanfelice, Ricardo, and Pablo Nanez. ‘Hybrid Equations (HyEQ) Toolbox for Matlab’. Version 3.0, 15 October 2022. [https://github.com/pnanez/HyEQ_Toolbox](https://github.com/pnanez/HyEQ_Toolbox). Documentation at [https://hyeq.github.io](https://hyeq.github.io). 

The toolbox can also be installed directly from Matlab through their Add-Ons Explorer. As the stable version is already two years old and they also offer a beta version 3.1.0.04, which was last updated on April 28, 2024, the beta version seems the way to go for our purposes. The authors will certainly appreciate any feedback.

Other programming languages seem to be missing a similar toolbox/package. How about developing one in Julia?
