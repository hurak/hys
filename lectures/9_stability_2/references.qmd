The same resources as for the previous lecture on stability.   

Some more online resources, in particular for multiple (also piecewise) Lyapunov functions, are @decarloPerspectivesResultsStability2000, @johanssonComputationPiecewiseQuadratic1998, @petterssonHybridSystemStability2002, @hassibiQuadraticStabilizationControl1998. The are all quite readable.

Besides the LMI and SOS programming/optimization, we need one particular result known as the S-procedure. Some treatment of S-procedure is in @boydLinearMatrixInequalities1994, pages 23 and 24, and @boydConvexOptimization2004, page 655.
