## Knowledge (remember and understand)

- Give a definition of a hybrid automaton. In particular, describe all the key components.
- Explain the differences in roles played in a hybrid automaton by the location (or mode) invariants and guard sets. 

## Skills (use the knowledge to solve a problem)

- Find a model of a simple dynamical system in the form of a hybrid automaton.
- Implement a simple hybrid automaton in Stateflow.
